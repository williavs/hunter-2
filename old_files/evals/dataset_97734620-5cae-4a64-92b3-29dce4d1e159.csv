Meanwhile, a leading household products company implemented a new trade promotion management (TPM) system over the last year because “the organization needed consistent processes, tools and data that would allow us to perform advanced trade analytics,” says the vice president of revenue growth management (who requested anonymity). When TPM was still in its infancy back in 2006, Forrester Research reported, “Many consumer products companies are struggling with how to track, report and execute trade promotions effectively internally and … need to master that before figuring out how to manage it with their channel partners.""}, {""url"": ""https://consumergoods.com/trade-promotion-management-solutions-guide-2018"", ""content"": ""Negatively, first-generation TPM solutions are not providing the flexibility to manage in-depth promotional investment across the evolving omnichannel landscape; and a lack of clarity, from a poorly executed wider IT landscape and third-party data integration, can prevent companies from fully understanding the profitability and ROI of their trade investments. TPM tools must allow data to be merged with other sources (like brand marketing and social analytics) and used not only to standardize process and workflow, but also to enhance investment and promotion decisions across trade, consumer, shopper and A&P — and ultimately drive ROI.""}, {""url"": ""https://be.linkedin.com/in/carla-vieira-rodrigues-paschoalim-8255118"", ""content"": ""My professional background is rooted in international trade, with a diverse range of experience spanning various roles in both operations and sales.""}, {""url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/company/upclear"", ""content"": ""Overview:\nUpClear is a global Enterprise Software provider for Consumer Goods brands.
