insights rather than theoretical accuracy.

Usage:
    python evals/personality_eval.py

Requirements:
    - langsmith
    - pydantic
    - langchain

    You are evaluating the quality and practical effectiveness of a personality analysis for sales outreach.
    
    SCENARIO:
    A salesperson from {company_name} (the SELLER) is trying to sell to a prospect (the BUYER).
    The personality analysis is meant to help the {company_name} salesperson understand the prospect better
    and tailor their outreach accordingly.
    
    SELLER COMPANY CONTEXT:
    Company: {company_name}
    Description: {company_description}
    Pain Points Addressed: {company_pain_points}
    
    PROSPECT EXPECTED FOCUS:
    {expected_focus}
    
    GENERATED PERSONALITY ANALYSIS OF THE PROSPECT:
    {personality_analysis}
    
    CONVERSATION STYLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TALKING TO THE PROSPECT:
    {conversation_style}
    
    PROSPECT'S PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS:
    {', '.join(professional_interests) if professional_interests else 'None provided'}
    
    Evaluate this analysis based on how useful it would be for a {company_name} sales professional trying to connect with this prospect.
    Focus on practical application rather than theoretical accuracy.
    
    Your evaluation MUST follow this exact format and include all these sections:
    
    Practical Relevance: [score 1-5]
    Conversation Guidance: [score 1-5]
    Pain Point Identification: [score 1-5]
    Personality Insight Depth: [score 1-5]
    Company Context Integration: [score 1-5]
    Actionability: [score 1-5]
    Overall Value: [score 1-5]
    
    Strengths:
    - [First strength]
    - [Second strength]
    - [Additional strengths]
    
    Improvement Areas:
    - [First improvement area]
    - [Second improvement area]
    - [Additional improvement areas]
    
    Suggested Enhancements:
    - [First enhancement suggestion]
    - [Second enhancement suggestion]
    - [Additional enhancement suggestions]
    
    When evaluating, please use these criteria:
    
    1. Practical Relevance: How relevant and applicable are the insights for real sales conversations?
    2. Conversation Guidance: How specific and helpful are the conversation tactics, openers, and approaches?
    3. Pain Point Identification: How accurately and deeply are the prospect's professional pain points and challenges identified?
    4. Personality Insight Depth: How nuanced and specific are the personality insights beyond generic observations?
    5. Company Context Integration: How well does the analysis integrate {company_name}'s value propositions to address the prospect's needs?
    6. Actionability: How immediately actionable are the recommendations for sales outreach?
    7. Overall Value: What is the overall value of this analysis for improving sales conversations?
    
    Be critical but fair - this evaluation is meant to help improve the system, not to artificially inflate scores.
