Company Context Workflow

This module implements a simple workflow that analyzes a company's website
to generate a concise context summary for use in personality analysis.

Usage:
    analyzer = CompanyContextAnalyzer(openrouter_api_key, tavily_api_key)
    company_context = await analyzer.analyze_company("https://example.com")

Requirements:
    - langchain
    - langgraph
    - langchain_openai
    - tavily_python

        I need to deep-dive research on a company with URL: {company_url} - and I need to UNLEARN everything I think I know about generic search queries.
        
        Your task is to create EXACTLY 4 hyper-specific, needle-moving search queries that will help me understand:
        1. The exact company website URL and its main pages (about, products, services, etc.)
        2. The PAIN POINTS this company claims to solve - not just what they do, but what PROBLEMS they actually FIX for their customers
        3. Their exact GTM approach, sales methodology, and how they position against competitors - SPECIFICALLY focusing on their claims of differentiation and unique selling points
        4. Their TARGET MARKETS and GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS - specifically where they operate, which regions/countries they target, and how they adapt their solutions to different geographic markets
        
        THIS IS CRITICAL: 
        - Drop the corporate fluff - I need to know what keeps their BUYERS up at night
        - Extract the company name from the URL and include it with industry-specific jargon 
        - Use words like "challenges," "pain points," "struggles," "barriers," and "obstacles" in your queries
        - Include terms about their claimed competitive advantages, unique approach, or methodology
        - Focus ENTIRELY on what makes them different, what problems they solve, and where they operate - nothing else matters
        - For the first query, make sure to include the exact URL and terms like "official website" "main pages" "about us" "products" "services"
        
        You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON array of strings. Each string should be a search query.
        
        Example of the EXACT format required:
        ```json
        [
          "example.com official website main pages about us products services",
          "GTM Wizards B2B lead generation pain points challenges solved ICP development pipeline management go-to-market strategy",
          "GTM Wizards competitive advantage unique approach methodology differentiation vs traditional agencies market positioning",
          "GTM Wizards target markets geographic focus regional expansion international local adaptation strategy"
        ]
        ```

        SALES DEEP DIVE: Company at {company_url}
        
        SKIP THE FLUFF. As a killer sales professional, you need to understand this company so you can:
        1. Know EXACTLY what problems they solve
        2. Understand how they make money
        3. See through their marketing BS to find their TRUE differentiators
        4. Identify who ACTUALLY buys from them and why
        5. Determine WHERE they operate and how problems/solutions differ by region{user_geography_note}
{search_results_section}
        
        Based on the search results above, you're going to use the Route-Ruin-Multiply framework to create a KILLER sales-oriented company profile. Take time to THINK STEP BY STEP through:
        
        1. PAINS & SOLUTIONS: Identify 3-4 SPECIFIC pain points this company claims to solve. Not vague marketing speak - the actual business problems their customers have that keep decision-makers up at night. Pair each pain with how they specifically claim to solve it.
        
        2. DIFFERENTIATION: Analyze what truly makes them unique in their space - find the 2-3 things they do differently from competitors that customers actually care about. Cut through the BS.
        
        3. BUYER PROFILE: Who are their ACTUAL buyers? What titles, industries, and company sizes? What priorities and pressures do these buyers have?
        
        4. TARGET GEOGRAPHY: Identify their primary geographic target markets - where are they selling? Include both current regions and expansion targets. Explain how problems and solutions might differ by region (regulatory differences, market maturity, cultural factors).{user_geography_note}
        
        5. OBJECTION INSIGHTS: Based on their positioning, what are the likely 1-2 objections prospects raise when considering them? Think about cost, implementation time, competing priorities, and regional challenges.
        
        6. SALES APPROACH: How do they likely sell? Direct? Channel? Product-led? What's their conversion strategy and pricing model? Do they adapt their approach by region?
        
        Finally, synthesize all of this into ONE KILLER PARAGRAPH that captures the essence of this company as if you were explaining it to a CEO in an elevator. This is your only chance to explain what they do, who they serve, what problems they solve, how they're different, where they operate, and why anyone should care. Make every word count, kill the fluff, and add something truly insightful.
        
        ALSO PROVIDE: A concise one-line statement of their primary geographic focus (e.g., "North American enterprise market" or "Global with emphasis on EMEA financial sector").
