        - **Start Small**: Begin with a small contact list (5-10 contacts) to learn how the system works
        - **Size Limit**: The system cannot handle lists larger than 50 rows of contacts (lots of AI processing happening)
        - **SEP Preparation**: Check what custom contact fields are available in your Sales Engagement Platform before trying to import
        - **Email Content**: Generated emails contain only the body text - you'll need to add greetings and signatures in your SEP
