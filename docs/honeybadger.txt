Honey Badger Mindset
Always keep coming in like the tide, like a bill collector.
My friend Pat owed a credit card company 15 Gs. Every morning he got the same call,
"Patrick, this is Joe Maricelli; call me back.” I got curious, picked up the phone, and
handled it.
This is exactly what I said, "Joe, Patrick will never pay this bill. But if you'll settle for two
thousand dollars right now, he's open to it."
"Sure; what's your card number?" I always tell this story because people need help
figuring out how to settle up on their credit card debts. Joe never lost his cool and
called unceasingly. He broke through.
4-5 V-mails. Wait, that’s some kind of code he cracked. What if I go full Joe Maricelli on
B2B? Hence, I once called a VP of Data 40 days in a row; we later laughed about it at a
conference when we finally met. I've never received a restraining order at this level.
CXOs call me back, though, and try to hire me or train their people because they
admit, “You reminded me of me when I was younger, Justin.” True story.
As Craig Kleeman says, they must react. Your prospects are spiders in the drain; if you
turn the spigot up, they always crawl back out after. But if you turn on a fire hose of


persistent insight, you finally get their attention. Effective C-Level prospecting is always
laced with honey and finesse; impossible-to-reach prospects only respond to your
gravitas and acumen. (Hard for AI to emulate)
Don’t forget to put the honey into your best “stately” honey badger.
Honey badgers are astoundingly resilient animals, immune to cobra venom, take
porcupine quills and keep running, and scare away a pride of lions. Doesn’t this sound
like “prospecting” in the 2020s and beyond?
The other animal I love to talk about is a great white shark; they swim even while
sleeping. They often fully breach the ocean’s surface when they eat a seal. Imagine the
raw power of this apex predator to swim that hard. Hat tip to Craig Simons at Allego,
I’ll throw in orcas and wolves as they work in teams.
Give this book to another executive and co-sell, or if you’re in the same org, split the
commission on some deals. Synergize your application of these ideas.
Metaphors abound in our attitudes to selling to the powerful. (I wrote about this at
length in Codex 16.)
Sell Around The Curve (future visioning)
© Matt Howard
C-Levels never buy around your core offering. 101 content doesn't work. Play up to


their intelligence with the 202 and 303 levels, aka ‘the art of the possible.’ Don't be
"SaaS for Dummies."
Nobody understands this strategy better than Benioff (ever notice that safe harbor
statement before every Dreamforce preso?) I used to sell mobile marketing
automation technology, and this is what it looked like:
●
Sell around the curve (we opened sales focused on personalized push
notifications & instant surveys)
●
Closed downhill into the core (they ultimately bought basic “push”)
●
Sell to Innovators & Early Adopters (comprise 16% of any market according to
Geoffrey Moore’s curve)
In the words of Gary Littlefair, “Deals often close on one use case.” Keep this in mind
when doing use-case selling, a trojan horse in Enterprise. Sellers get all snarled up on
FFB: feature, function benefits, so “we get delegated down to who we sound like.”
In short: Sell the future vision road map features, then close on your core product
offering.
I’m working with a client selling self-piloting drones for high-voltage power plant sites.
Unique value prop: “Imagine if you didn’t have to send humans in bucket trucks. Now
imagine if you didn’t need to send humans at all. Just install the drone substation
boxes, and the drones self-deploy, fly around monitoring dangerous, million voltage
grids, and go back to the box autonomously.”
This tech isn’t even built out yet anywhere on the planet, but you start to message
around this and rapidly bring in every decision-maker in the space because they want
to “see around the curve.”
Sell around the curve, close on the core. This is the great secret to attracting the
fastest SaaS sales cycles.
Another technique I respect comes from Townsend Wardlaw's Referential Value
Proposition.
“Don’t talk about what you do or do for people. Talk about how your services have
served others, like the individual you’re contacting, in their own words. What’s the
problem on their mind?


●
Example: “I serve founders of 2-10MM companies like yours who are stuck
somewhere on the journey and are getting frustrated by the fact they have to
do everything themselves despite hiring people.”
GPT Lab (by Greg Meyer): Skate to where the puck is going
GPT can help you think about potential future outcomes, even if it can’t predict the
future.
One way to think about this is to build prompts that help you think about challenges
in short (a few days or months), medium (6-12 months), and long-term time frames
(2+ years):
“Help me build a prompt on encouraging thinking along different time frames. I
want you to help me consider challenges and opportunities in short (a few days or
months), medium (6-12 months), and long-term time frames (2+ years) - include in
the prompt the ability to ask me what question I want to consider. Wait to write out
the whole prompt until you have asked me the question and I have answered, then
submit the prompt as if I have asked you that prompt.”

“Unlock Unlimited Pipeline,” and 2-5X your
