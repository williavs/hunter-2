CODEX XIV
Nuke Objections (Ack-Peel)


Codex XIV
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
Alas! You're on the phone with a prospect, using the guides, and suddenly, you get 
some wild Zingers and you freak out!  — you're caught flat-footed, tongue-tied, deer 
in the headlights, your palms sweat and you haven't the foggiest WTF to say. This 
codex is the Motherload of Rebuttals to bail yourself out of any Objection. Spot the 
patterns (heuristics), make them your own. 
Classically speaking: 
ux Understand the objectionx
cx Show the prospect you understand itx
^x Check if it's still there.
But it’s not enough. The top request I get on training material is “JM, how do you 
handle objections?” What are the rebuttals that work, right? It’s a trick question. If you 
are effective enough with Route Ruin Multiply in the first ROUTE step, you truly won’t 
get any objections at all; you’ll wait for the Polarity Shift (creating true desire in them), 
and then they’re driving it. But in the Pitch-Later step of Multiply or RRR (Route-Ruin-
Rip) — there’s often still fear, concern or doubt. 
The best way to face objections is: don’t get them. 
Ô Many objections and brush offs are a recoil: just repeat your ask x
Ô Feel it out — if it sounds like they're at a pizza parlor with family, close to a 
meeting and bail x
Ô Know the difference between a comment and objection — if it’s just a negative 
comment: repeat the ask. Í
Ô The next best way to handle latent objections or lingering issues is Ack-Peel™ x
Ô Spend time understanding the true objection and play it back to them, then mirror 
and peel back the layers.

Ack-Peel Objection Handling Formula
The most effective way to handle an objection is to peel the onion with a half 
acknowledgment and another immediate open question. 
See Codex 7 for Route Ruin Multiply — RRM
Social Aikido, Tai-Chi Motions 
They strike, you use their motion to flip them. This is judo, aikido, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, 
Tai-Chi. Use their power on them to make it gracious, seamless and eliminate the 
appearance of the fight. Use your opponent's motion: defensiveness, 
combativeness, domination bounces right back at them. Metaphor: When they hit 
you hard keep moving their hand and roll them on the mat.
Heuristics:
Ã Agree, ask an open question ¶
Ã Empathize, challenge calmly  — never break your Steven Segal dead calm, 
detached state¶
Ã Detach from the outcome and never reveal hunger or eagerness, no “salesiness" 
or "commission breath" as Josh Braun calls it.

JM’s Top 11
Signature rebuttal frames:
I’m not interested
How do you know you’re not interested, I haven’t even pitched you yet? 
(sarcastically) 
I’ll pass
Hey super quick favor, can you please coach me on how I could have made a 
better cold call? I just bombed!
It’s too expensive
Relative to what ROI? We see 3-10X ROI on average. So it’s a cash register vs. a 
cost center. If you put in 100K into a slot machine and got 300K, wouldn’t you 
invest all day? 
Send me some information
I could do that but this will blow your mind, every time in my career I send info it 
goes into the circular file. Are you really telling me, I’ll never talk to you again? 
Admit it!
We don't have any budget left
That’s fine, what about pulling from a lateral budget like Marketing?

We have that covered / All set / We have everything we need
Oh excellent, I make these calls all day, can you tell me how you’ve managed 
to solve this because most people I call are struggling.
I'm not responsible for that
No worries, who’s the appropriate person to reach out to — would you be up to 
make a warm intro? 
We have a vendor
I get it, most of our customers were with another vendor but when they saw 
how our solution could augment/turbocharge their existing stack, they plugged 
us in any way alongside it to multiply the effectiveness  — RUIN (from RRM) — 
they’re great, how’s it working out for you? [pause]
This isn’t a priority now
I totally get it, it could be high urgency in another quarter, what would make it a 
priority for you? 

or

Can you walk me through what you are currently focused on and I can help you 
with that.

It’s confidential
That’s fine, I assume it’s [massive competitor], they’re great — how’s it working 
out for you? [assumptive RUIN]

That’s fine, happy to put an MNDA in place, so we can discuss. Sound good? 
I’d never take a cold call
Wait, you’re running [sales/marketing/revenue] and you won’t take calls? Aren’t 
I doing exactly the best practice you want your people to do? [challenger]
It's too expensive
What does expensive mean to you? What return would you need to see to 
invest in any solution right now? 
A Classic HubSpot Objection List +
JMM Signature Rebuttal Approach 
Now let’s apply what we learned above to any possible objection you can think of. (I 
think I’ve covered them all; if not, let me know!) Feel free to steal these and make 
them your own! Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Stick and move. Stick and move. 
Fast half ack, open question. The key is speed — keep them talking, open questions, 
and provoke w/ the question to make them think. If they genuinely think they’ll stay 
on the line. You’ll repeatedly see me use Humor Diffusion, Adaptive Mirroring, 
Empathy, Self Deprecation, and Challenger type questions in these. The main thing I 
do is — let them know I hear them, then provoke or make them reflect. As in 
everything JMM — it’s all a subtle form of pattern interrupt.

There's no money
I understand, but is that because you invested in other areas? Tell me more...
We don't have any budget left
That’s fine, what if you pulled it from another P&L like say, MKT?
I need to use this budget somewhere else
Makes sense, what’s the priority now? Curious.
I don't want to get stuck in a contract
No worries, we hear that all the time — what if I could offer it as a pilot or give 
you an out at 60 days just in case (I’ll check w/ my manager) [approve prior] 
We're already working with another vendor
Oh, that’s interesting. Who is it? (If they can’t say) I bet it’s someone like [name 
biggest competitor]; they’re great — how’s that working out for you? [assumed 
RUIN]
I'm locked into a contract with a competitor
That happens all the time, when does it expire: maybe we could buy it out? 

Not a problem, you could plug us in as a force multiplier/turbocharger or “to 
multiply the effectiveness of your current stack”

I can get a cheaper version somewhere else
I get it, you can always go cheaper but look at it this way: I’m selling you a cash 
register, not a cost center. If you go cheaper, the lack of [service, efficiency, 
results] could cost you millions more. Think of the opportunity cost for lack of 
ROI? You could save thousands or literally lose millions. Choice is yours! 
I'm happy with your competitor
I understand, what do you like most about it just so I can approach the space 
more informed? 

That’s great, is there anything additional you’d like their solution to do? (Now 
peel the onion — RUIN step in RRM) 
Competitor X says [false statement about your product].
Ha! I can’t believe they said that. They must be a bigger fan of our product than 
we thought. I’d be happy to demo to you exactly how that’s not true.
I'm not authorized to sign off on this
No problem, don’t worry about that yet — let’s just build some consensus. Who 
else on your team should see this? — even “Should Amy on your team see 
this?” [you’ve mapped the buying committee prior]

I can't sell this internally
That’s OK, I can help you. What makes you say that?

Then...

OK, what if we set up a call with {name} to patiently walk them through the 
value prop? 
[Economic buyer] isn't convinced
Totally get it, we’d typically build a business case with Sarah to cost-justify this 
(lower TCO), when’s she available? 
 We're being downsized/bought out
I hear you, sometimes the best times to put our solution in place is during a 
point of contraction to get the wheels moving in the right direction again, up 
and to the right. 
There's too much going on right now
I get it, you’re super busy. You’re like 99% of our customers. Wouldn’t it be 
worth moving this up the priority list if it can return [outcome — make money, 
save money, reduce risk, satisfy regulation]? 
I'm part of a buying group
Excellent, I realize it takes a dozen decision-makers to get deals done now — 
can you coach me on how to get in front of the group?

Ha! Neither have I. Just kidding, although we are new to the market, some of 
the best innovations came from a couple people in a garage with a dog. 
Google? [humor diffuse]
We're doing great in this area
That’s awesome to hear, how did you crush it? Like seriously, I talk to hundreds 
of Directors of [function], and most struggle. How did you do it specifically? So 
I can improve my knowledge...
We don't have the business plan
Alright, well we designed this solution for businesses at all stages — why do 
you think you’d need a plan to implement it? Just help me understand as most 
of our most successful clients don’t. 
It's just not important right now
Hmm, what would make it important? (h/t Voss mirroring)
I don't see what your product could do for me
Well, it’s all my fault. I just face-planted on this call. How can I make it up to 
you? [humor diffuse]
I don't understand your product
Neither do I. Laugh. In all seriousness though, tell me where you got
confused — there are zero dumb questions. I’ll walk you through it.

I've heard complaints about you from [company]
No doubt everyone has them on G2 — it’s like Amazon — a 4.2 star is far more 
trustworthy than a full 5, wouldn’t you agree? [h/t Todd Caponi Transparency 
Sale]
We don't have capacity to implement the product
Not to worry, our team does the heavy lift on implementation so that it’s turnkey 
and frictionless to get you up and running. 

OK, when do you think you’d get bandwidth?
Your product is just too complicated
I understand, that’s totally my fault. What if I describe it again in language a 4-
year could understand? Aka ME! [humor diffusion]
You don't understand my challenges. I need help with Y, not X.
[agree] You're right, while I may not understand your specific business 
challenges, I have helped many similar customers navigate these waters. Can 
you tell me more about Y? 
You don't understand my business
Granted, but we help businesses like yours every single day. What did I say that 
makes you feel that way?

Your product doesn't have X feature, and we need it
That may be true now, but if it's that key to the deal we could potentially move 
it up in the roadmap. [pre-approve this]
We're happy the way things are
I get it, change is stressful. Even if there's a ton of upside, would you still stay 
put? 
I don't see the potential for ROI
Well OK, what kind of ROI were you looking for? 
It's just a fad
Sure but they said that about Cloud and CRM. Billions made, billions served. 
Curious, why do you think that? 
Your product doesn't work with our current set-up
How do you know, can you please verify with me what your current setup is? 

Sure, while we don’t support Linux today, we’re about to release a patch for 
that (buy time) 
Your product sounds great, but I'm too swamped right now
I totally understand, we’re all swamped now. Because of that, I’ve created a 
demo that only takes 7 minutes to watch — should we walk through it now 
or the top of any hour in the next few days? [reduce friction of TIME]

Do you say that to every cold caller or am I the lucky one? [humor diffusion]

Unlearning Sales

salesborgs.ai
I'd teach someone tennis who has yet to play because it's harder to change a two-
handed backhand into a one-handed with topspin than teaching you to hit the ball 
right from the beginning. I worked with a tennis pro and still frequently hit the ball 
over the back fence after a year. See my point?
If you're reading this as an old dog avoiding new tricks, brace yourself. It will be hard. 
If you're new to sales, take note and develop good habits now to dominate a 
backward industry.
You must begin with a Beginner’s Mind to get markedly better at anything. Only by 
acknowledging our ignorance on a subject can we grow. Additionally, we play as we 
practice, so it takes “deliberate practice” of new skill sets to habituate them and 
become unconsciously competent until we achieve mastery, and it’s second nature.
You may not believe this, but most of what's out there—sales stuff—is predicated on 
a premise from 90's tactics or, as Todd Caponi would say, modern as of 1910.
So why is everyone addicted to the crack of old methods? Old habits die hard. I don’t 
need to be an anthropologist to convince you; we do what we are programmed to do 
by our upbringing and society. And acting naturally is the worst advice I could give you.
We are raised to care what other people think and be polite. That puts the “civil” in 
civilization, but civility is killing sales. Influential people don’t want lackeys; they want 
to pay Challenger consultants who have achieved coveted “trusted advisor” status 
because they tell the truth.
I learned to be a lone wolf—a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
Chalk it up to peer pressure, social acceptance, or tradition: Marketing approves, and 
your 10th-grade English teacher agrees. The bottom line is that bagging 1 in 1,000 
prospects is where most teams are if you just analyze sequencer data. You (aspiring 
eagles reading this) should be able to open opportunities with 20 of 200 accounts.
The crux of sales is standing out in an ever-noisier attention economy. What doesn’t

stand out? Conformity. Plain white tees and khakis. To wildly succeed in sales, you’d 
need to implement strategies and tactics that make you the purple cow of your 
industry. And that’s what I did; I just did it a roundabout way and developed systems 
to teach it to people.
I had a gift of gab, then sales; I rested on my laurels for a decade, got a mentor, and 
codified all this bizarre stuff.
I laugh thinking about Aaron Ross’s first response. “It’s too wordy; go on a speaking tour 
and see what resonates.” Luckily, I didn’t take his advice and made it even more esoteric.
I quit my day job as a highly successful VP of Sales in SaaS because the people I taught 
were improving rapidly. One rep on a garbage truck suddenly made the most money 
he’d ever made and bought a house within nine months of working with me. SDRs were 
moving off PIPs. Reps were doubling and tripling incomes in under 18 months.
It wasn’t about securing qualified meetings and opportunities or hitting quotas 
anymore. I was transforming lives. I coach executives at all skill levels to do things 
beyond their ability.
One, find shortcuts based on my pattern recognition of 20 years of doing everything 
wrong, investing millions (mainly of OPP—other people’s money), and making tens of 
millions. Two, pinpoint mindsets, limiting beliefs holding them back, or unique 
elements of genius they are missing.
I was the first to champion Political Sales, which should be a book, albeit wildly 
unpopular. If you’re great at what you do, that’s paradoxically probably why you’re 
not advancing. Half the battle is mastering the internal politics of SaaS bureaucracy 
to move up. Selling yourself up and down the food chain, so you get promoted, or
they’ll keep you a cog in the wheel, Orwellian as it may sound. I moved laterally for 
15 years, ceilinged on income and paying innumerable dues.
Are you sure you know sales? Or are you brainwashed by tradition?


Codex XVII
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
I thought I did, too, after ten years of smashing up against my income ceiling, burning 
my feet like Icarus. I read hundreds of books and applied everything. If you find me a 
sales author, methodology, or top book over the last 30 years, I haven’t read, I’ll send 
you a gift certificate for a steak dinner. “First prize, set of steak knives.”
Like David Copperfield with magic, I became a modern-day sales historian and get to 
hang with Mike Bosworth, who invented “solution selling.” My mentors trained millions 
of sellers; I’ll get there. I finally attached a syllabus to Tech-Powered Sales after 
reading many of these books 4 or 5 times, struggling to apply and distill knowledge.
The big secrets? They weren't in sales books; they were hidden in plain sight. 
Neuroscience and relationship dynamics are more revealing than a series of 
gimmicky micro methods trumpeted by ten thousand talking heads.
I found what worked by watching the most successful people in my industry. They 
mentored me, and I fused what I read with what I applied and observed from top 
performers. This is a constant refrain in sales books except for one significant 
difference. Those who came before me contributed to the pantheon; I’ve always 
been looking to do the exact opposite of everyone else. Like Groucho Marx said 
best, “I wouldn’t want to be part of any group that would have me as a member.”
I never took it from David Sandler. I imagined what if I were a modern David vs. the 
Goliath of the SaaS Sales Industrial Complex and sales training industry churning out 
lousy advice and holding reps down to 40% quota attainment.
I wrote an entire Illuminati Manifesto here about how the VCs and powers that be 
suppress us. People laughed and yawned; it was my Citizen Kane. People seemed 
angrier that I’d challenge ‘personalization at scale.’
I studied and traveled with seven-figure closers and found what they did to radically fly 
in the face of the prevailing sales order. Like the tennis example, I realized I'd have to 
unlearn my core strokes. Heck, probably everything I ever knew about sales.

Psychology and human behavior are the blackjack dealer, and the house always wins.
Truisms I found in sales are like gravity.
If you drop an apple anywhere on this planet, it always falls. I began searching for the 
gravitational elements of sales and saw the themes emerging repeatedly.
I've written books and systems. You've read them. Now I'm writing a document that 
shows the philosophy behind my work. This will help you unlearn everything you know 
about sales and rebuild your career.
Fix your mindset, and your skillset will follow.
Fix your skillset, and the money will follow.
Earning millions in sales and executive coaching was never in the cards for me. After 
ten years in incubators and telemarketing, I reached 45K income (what I now make on 
one client) and plateaued. I moved to Silicon Valley, searched for a sales job for three 
months, was down to my last two grand, and got a FedEx with an offer letter of 45K. 
Epic fail. Back to square one.
So how did a high school dropout with zero SaaS experience become one of the 
highest-paid VPs, write bestselling books on top publishers, set world records for 
prospecting, and then train hundreds of companies and thousands of reps?
I unlearned sales.
I fell into sales at 21. I knew one millionaire who was 30, and he ran a call center. I 
quickly became top 5 out of 10,000 reps and got cocky. So even though I had a team 
of 300 by 23 and 1,000 in Costa Rica and the Philippines by 29, I never made any real 
money, studied, got a mentor, or bettered myself.
It was at Salesforce in 2011 that I reached out to Tony J. Hughes in Australia, relatively 
obscure at the time, with this search on YouTube. "A challenge to Challenger." After 
spending a day in a blizzard at the Hilton Chicago, going through another 9-step 
‘Ology’ framework, I became disillusioned with the complexity of training theory

vis-a-vis the visceral simplicity of what I observed top reps doing firsthand.
That empirical observation gleaned over 13 startups and then running Ops for an 
outbound automation startup with 100+ concurrent clients led to what became the 
simplicity of COMBO and realizing the power of blended combinations or "triples." I 
made the breakthrough as a case study with Tony that the saturation and speed of 
touches mattered as much, if not more than what you said, because of how 
smartphone alerting works.
I wrote TQ (what became Tech-Powered Sales) to automate all the manual touches. 
That was a massive success because it accurately predicted the future of all B2B 
sales technology. We read the tea leaves still to this day.
What's still missing in sales methodology, process, systems, and frameworks?
It is unlearning the bad habits and behaviors that are killing deals.
You, the seller, and how you think, which influences your actions, are the reason you 
are failing. Take a long hard look in the mirror and realize what you've known. 
Everything you need to succeed is within yourself.
This writing is less of a memoir and more of an instruction manual to change your 
DNA. To take you from fear, consternation, and doubt with your current mental 
gymnastics and give you unlimited power—control over the outcome.
How we think determines how we act. We habituate what we do most consistently. 
Most sellers fail because they need to be more consistent in their approach to daily 
execution.
To me, prospecting is as essential as breathing.

Unlearning Mindset
Thinking and growing rich needs a step added. Think, do the right things and then 
reap the benefits. Positive thinking, visualization, and goal setting are excellent ways 
to waste 15 years getting underpaid, as I did.
You probably don’t think you’re worthy of 500K per year. You have two binary 
choices. You master politics in your role, so your boss advances you inside your 
company. Or you quit and get your base raised and better comp. Reps come to me 
to double their income or more. I ask, is anyone at your company making 750K/yr? If 
the answer is “no,” it’s a little far-fetched that the system isn’t working against you.
To succeed in any startup, you must first qualify that startup in or out. You’re in the 
driver’s seat now. Stop being desperate to get hired. It’s a cosmic reverse.
You, as the rep, hire the startup.
Here’s my 3-step formula for sales role Nirvana:
ÙÏ Product-market fit (traction: need vs. nice to have¾
ºÏ Team (you like your manager¾
¼Ï Upside (commissions are possible)
Unlearning Money
What happens when you look someone in the whites of their eyes and say, "A full 
production order with us is 1.2 million dollars." Talk about breaking the ice and seeing 
someone squirm. They'll at last respect you. Wealthy, successful people who can buy 
expensive things or unlock massive P&L are testing your comfort level early on, 
whether you're a "player" who can make a real deal happen or a phenomenal waste 
of their time.

Butt heads, they’ll love it. Players are bulls in the China shop. Make them see 
themselves in your temerity.
I love to have money conversations up front, even in enterprise situations where 
there is procurement, sharks, laser beams, and razor wire. Here’s why? Many P&L 
holders have a threshold of approval that is secretive.
You can put up a multi-million dollar deal and get crushed in procurement with a 
rating scale where they demand the pricing at seven figures for the 100K pilot, or you 
can use a bucket technique on production orders to figure out the threshold.
I was sitting at a Fortune 500 outside Chicago talking about an entire product 
enterprise-level agreement (the mythic ‘ELA’) worth millions in TCV when our 
stakeholder revealed that the most money a pilot could be without going through a 
3-month legal review was $98,000. Imagine if I’d gone for a 10K pilot project as 
instructed instead of pressure-testing the limit. 70K left on the table and much less
likelihood of renewing.
Unlearning Targeting
Sales is archery. Obsess about lining up the targets, then focus on the arrow tip and 
the compound bow. Are you even hitting the mark? Is it the right target? 80% of the 
accounts you target need to be a better fit. 20% are in the zone based on Physics 
Law. Pareto is constantly governing everything. The great Chet Holmes (RIP) talks
about 3% of prospects in the market, but you need to move from servicing demand 
to creating it. (Jim Holden Level IV)
The three states of business are self-evident. The last two are the same: affluence 
(growth mode), stasis (flat growth), and decay. If you’re stagnating or decaying, it’s 
still a downward spiral.

Pretty hard to get this data from privately held companies, but you need to establish 
trust, even MNDAs, and find this out, so you don’t waste your time.
Another maxim I’ve developed is a Yogi Berraism, “Buyer’s buy.” Over a decade ago, 
I witnessed this rare phenomenon in SaaS where the same decision-makers were 
like car collectors, who repeatedly bought in the category from different vendors, 
even as they changed companies and roles.
Unlearning Email
Email as a philosophy comes out of famous copywriting texts, some going back to 
the 60s from the early Mad Men days with the dawn of Ogilvy and advertising on 
Madison Avenue. Old-school marketers believe that since there’s a human reading it, 
the same laws of copywriting hold today.
These traditionalists and purists get good at journalism, building white papers, and 
gaining marketing roles with heavy influence in all technology SaaS company 
marketing and product marketing departments.
The problem is we live in a mobile responsive designed world. Send an email to 
yourself. You can see about 18 words, give or take. Once you open an email, you 
need to scroll to see all of it, if it’s expository or multi-paragraph. We usually don’t 
even open it because the subject line is unremarkable. Maybe, if we respect the 
vendor or person, we start to get back to it later, but it gets buried in the onslaught of
thousands of smartphone alerts daily.
Much like Google figured out the ZMOT or “zero moments of truth” for search intent, the 
holy grail that’s driven trillions in advertising, you get a nanosecond to appear on the 
phone email client and get a click-through. You get one glance to get the click-through.

What if you could make those 18 words so good that they converted into a meeting?
What if you thought of email-like ad units, text messages, or banner ads: as good ones?
Email is, therefore, not a template or multi-step process. Email is about radical brevity. 
It’s holographic and fractal in that you get nanoseconds to capture attention and 
convert. An email is a form of the ad unit, and reverse engineering from this premise, 
you’ll start to do a lot of things very differently, which I’ve outlined in the Codices.
One fun story I’m not sure I’ve put anywhere was a day when I had access to a 
300,000-person database. I sent this single sentence in the title, “holding a VIP party 
at the Big Conference, who should I add to the list from your team?” Within 45 
minutes, I received over 700 responses.
The net worth was billions; these were gaming founders, venture capitalists, and 
board members. I sent one message out of a sequencer that looked like a text 
message, and the responses rained down like crazy with open CC recommending all 
relevant colleagues.
Impossible to reach stakeholders we always believed didn’t even get your email, got it. 
They all do.
Unlearning Phone
Never act naturally.
Never communicate like you were raised. Being civil and friendly, developing rapport, 
and treating this like running into a fraternity brother in a grocery store will make you 
fail. I’m paid ridiculously well (like a top trial lawyer) to make good reps the best in the
world, to change the law of averages, so every tactic they use outperforms their peers. 
I’m a secret weapon and a unique competitive advantage.

So naturally, I quickly found you get three heartbeats when someone picks up a 
phone. I found it’s not even seven; you don’t get 7. They are already hanging up on 
me if I’m talking for One One Thousand, Two One Thousand, Three One Thousand. 
Belfort and I agree here!
So I AB tested openers like crazy. I found the only way to win on the phone is to 
mess with power dynamics. And that’s why it’s precisely like relationship science, 
and you should, in essence, “neg C-Levels.” What this means is you challenge 
authority, behave in ways they’re not used to, earn respect with boldness, let them 
talk, and let them be powerful. That’s how I stumbled upon the ultimate Jedi 
Mindtrick of phone openers: the RRM pattern interrupt array.
We know from psychology that listening is a gift, as is curiosity.
Whoever is doing the listening is in control.
So why is every call opener “the reason for my call” and pitch? Or a gimmick, “can I 
get X seconds of your time?” or a reminder of soliciting, “this is a cold call. want to 
roll the dice?” or a manipulation, “did I catch you at a bad time?”
Never remind a prospect you are soliciting them. Never apologize. Never guilt. Always 
and only listen, enable, inspire, challenge, and dig deeper into pain and latent pain.
You’re all familiar with my route-ruin-multiply (RRM) technique at this point, but the 
genesis of this creativity is that the prospect has a false sense of power over me. 
They’re used to every rep kissing up to them. I’m not going to bow down or 
supplicate. As a pattern interrupt, I will come across as a peer with a value add. This 
becomes social Aikido. The bigger they are, the harder and faster I can roll them.
I first see if they’re the authority figure and what they do—even if I know—and this shifts 
the polarity. It's radical calling a VP of Mobile and asking, “who’s in charge of mobile 
strategy?” It also gets prospects to say “I am,” the most powerful two words in the 
human languages and the first two words God spoke when he created the universe.

Unlearning Social
LinkedIn is being used entirely wrong. Connect and pitch slapping and using it as a 
spamming entity are bonkers. Very few reach out for warm introductions. Their 
networks have grown so big with profiles they don’t even know this core feature 
doesn’t even work anymore. If you have TeamLink and can ask for warm intros from 
colleagues, you’re likely not trained on this Easter Egg that’s the entire premise of 
the Enterprise Nav edition.
Are you firing on signals?
I bet you’re not watching who adds you, who views you, and who interacts with your 
posts. If all you do is start interacting there, your entire LinkedIn strategy will unlock 
because it’s so rare. Look at the ZMOT or zero moments of intent I talk about on the 
clickthrough patterns in the email section. You can reach out when you get a
signal—a profile view, a like, a reshare, an inbound message, an invite request 
accept—in that crucial moment.
You can triple on signals. Facetime drop on signals. Loom to WhatsApp on signals.
That’s where my Fourth Frame technique, built around turning LinkedIn, WhatsApp, 
and Instagram DMs into a currency as valuable as a cold call “live connect” becomes 
so powerful. I find myself training reps, founders, and even CEOs on how to be 
natural and human and foster quality conversations.
The big miss on social is you ONLY talk about personal (hiking, charity, thought 
leadership) or work-related (your solution, trends, industry problems, etc.) Single-
mindedness and one-dimensionality are going on in social “networks” that used to 
be about organic networking.
I teach people to imagine bumping into the prospect at a TED Talk back at the 
original in Monterey, and posit, ‘what would you organically do and say?’ Nothing like 
what you’re doing in this circus that social media has become. This is my most

advanced technique, so I won’t share it here because it won’t make any sense like a 
Zen koan. But essentially, the Fourth Frame comes after the first three frames:
Contact someone—eras
r Sell a product—1,000 yeart
nr Close them on their time—Brian Trac
gr ROUTE—figure out if they even handle that thing (or get a referral)                         
– Justin Michael 202w
ar Fourth Frame = endless meetings (there’s gotta be some reason for you to hire 
me, right?!)
It’s easy to give you everything open source here. But to customize all these 
systems: mindsets, skillsets, strategies, techniques, tech stack optimization—where I 
come in is: implementation, execution, pattern matching, and drilling. Bransonian 
quantum leaps require major shifts in your mindset gleaned from my 20 years in 
sales failing forward.
Unlearning Discovery
I’ve been through SPIN training, Challenger, Sandler, Miller-Heiman, and as many as 
possible. There’s validity in all of them.
The problem with discovery is it’s an interrogation. Prospects these days will recoil, 
“Are you BANTing me?” “Are you Sandlering me?” What is this all about?
The concept of latent pain took me years to figure out. Prospects these days have no 
pain. Apathy is an epidemic. Latent is the pain hiding under the surface of the 
iceberg. That’s why reps these days find prospects saying this. “We’re good, all set, 
no interest, already have a vendor.”
Combatting the status quo and boredom as a condition and state of mind is tricky.


Codex XVII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
Not only are the real problems hiding under symptoms, but usually, the prospect is 
pretending nothing is wrong, rationally convinced themself, and numbing the pain. 
They don’t even know what’s going wrong under the surface.
The only way I have ever found to break through the hard shell of modern prospects 
to see the pain is to go much farther into the spectrum of pleasure until I get around 
the pain. It’s a wheel I discovered.
Only by focusing on what’s working with current vendors or homebrew (build vs. buy) 
processes can you get a prospect to feel safe enough, trust you enough, and reduce 
their inherent prospect resistance sufficiently that they open up to you and tell you 
what’s going wrong.
Then you can pull the string.
That’s why RUIN, my counter-intuitive answer to pain funnel and onion peeling, is so 
revolutionary. To find out what makes someone unhappy and dissatisfied, do what 
trillions of advertising dollars do. Show them the life they want. Ask them why they 
are happy.
Unlearning Qualification
I teach a process called the Anchor:
Budget, Timeline, Success Criteria, Compelling Event(Reason), Success Criteria, 
Competitors, Org Chart.
I wish it were arranged in an easy acronym. But this synergizes every other system 
like MEDDIC because the thing that creates urgency and moves the deal from a 
“nice to have” to a need to have is always “a compelling event/reason.”
Why are they going to lose their job (or get promoted)? Why would the house burn 
down? What’s so terrible that the company is threatening the exec to act now?


Codex XVII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
The deal is not qualified if you don’t understand the compelling event or reason. 
Now you can poke the wound and twist the knife before you bandage it, which is 
called ‘probing’ in most systems.
The bottom line is that qualification is not working because reps think it’s something 
you DO To a prospect: qualify them. Qualification is the countenance of the doctor, 
detective, or therapist, paraphrasing Jeff Thull’s classic archetypes.
You uncovered “qualification” in others. You test hypotheses. You dig for pain and 
latent pain; you seek to understand the problems hidden under systems. Too many 
salespeople get this one all wrong.
It feels like a CIA interrogation when they sit down for a discovery call if they can 
even get this far, becoming genuinely interested and peeling the onion, asking 
questions that lead to more questions than answers.
Unlock your inner Columbo.
Become a master detective and ferret out the true origin of everything. It’s powerful. 
This is the science of reflective questioning, eradicating this B2B guru obsession 
with open-ended questions.
Leading and guiding prospects to truly dig the deepest they’ve ever gone into the 
root of their issues is something only the most outstanding AI software raising 
billions now can do. Qualification, therefore, becomes “root cause analysis.”
Unlearning Demos
The way I do my demos is to pull up 60 slides and joke, “All set with my 60-slide 
deck?” I like to flip the meeting. “What did you want to get out of today.” Again, I 
open every forum by listening to the stakeholders.


Codex XVII
discord.gg/hypcccycl

Like a choose-your-own-adventure book from the 80s, they can pick the slides they 
want to see. One of the most legendary meetings I ever held with a billion-dollar 
gaming company involved just one slide. It was a custom Venn diagram, and we 
talked about it for two hours.
Unlearning Negotiation
The Harvard Negotiation Project’s work and Chris Voss's seem to dominate the 
modern negotiation canon. Read these books; they’re great. The problem is that 
neither one seems to encapsulate how to negotiate in a modern SaaS or Services 
environment.
Neither the ivory tower nor hostage negotiation will get you there in B2B.
The first myth I want to bust is the idea of free pilots, proof of concepts, PLG-like 
motions, and “land and expand” with a beachhead. It simply never worked. Just like 
an RFP, maybe I ever won one in 15+ years; it’s just a fallacy.
Your best bet is to anchor high and then provide limited concessions.
Give your highest possible number, and then break off a chunk below. The psychology 
supports a considerable number with limited concessions far outstrips starting small 
and then the sticker shock of building bigger. CFOs are in crisis mode, always cutting, 
so there’s no way you’ll get in the door and Trojan Horse your way into a six or 7-figure 
deal in this climate. Lowering the total cost of ownership (or TCO) works, the classic 
Oracle ‘consolidation’ enterprise hardware play, but more and more frequently, point 
solutions are locked in on multi-year deals. Hence, it’s nearly impossible for your 
customer to quit points without you buying out the contract.
Todd Caponi was my first big league sales trainer, former SAP at Salesforce. His 
Transparency book series is impressive, and he’s got the best system for negotiation 


Codex XVII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
I’ve ever seen, which I just call “the levers.”
Rather than an individual discount, you move the “timing of the money,” “multi-year 
commit,” “terms—quarterly/annual,” and “start date” around. This is savvy because, as 
Alan Weiss calls out, many times if you offer a 10% discount, they have to take it.
Procurement loves multi-year deals that drop the price tag. Many companies will pay 
upfront to realize significant gains now. Procurement teams get bonuses on how much 
money they can knock off the contract.
Money is far more valuable to you now than in a quarter. Repeat it with me.
The Voss work centers on how to have the negotiation conversation, but what mostly 
happens in technology or service sales is it’s just too expensive. Objections on cost stall 
deals. You lose the deal because the price won’t move, so hit it with a lever. One of the 
hardest-hitting strategies here is to provide a choice of yeses on the proposal per 
Weiss. It’s not like a Tuesday or Thursday lock-down setting a meeting. It’s more than 
the human brain likes to pull a Robert Frost or Clapton Crossroads and just ‘pick a road.’
Everyone wants to do a deal, that’s why they’re on the call. You just didn’t make a 
good enough offer.
I like to offer a discount for multiple months, years or quarters; money up front, better 
terms, etc. It works, everyone wins and you can run your business more predictably 
with annual lock-in and smooth forecasting.
Your CFO will hug you.
Before any negotiation occurs, you have to make sure you’re sitting with the CEO of the 
problem or virtually on Zoom. Most sellers are single-threaded, or in too small a P&L. All 
your deals need to be made with Presidents, GMs, CROs, or CFOs. If you’re currently 
closing business with VPS, that’s a significant problem. For a deep dissertation on ZOPA 
(zone of potential agreement), positional bargaining, and anchoring, hit Voss, Harvard 
Negotiation Project, and Dr. Chester L. Karrass.

Unlearning Closing
Coffee’s for closers. We all remember Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glen Ross. For years, 
my mentors taught me that if you’re having closing issues, it’s a problem upstream in 
some other process area. Then I traveled with master closers and realized “CLOSING” 
is a genuine phenomenon. I have watched OGs like Garrett MacDonald take a dead
opportunity, revive it and close it just off the sheer force of will, charisma, product 
knowledge, and nerve.
I went out to try to codify what this X factor is for all reps.
The first thing I’ll say about persuasion is it feels really manipulative until you amp it up 
to the level of leadership: where you’re guiding the prospect (or consensus of buying 
team) to make a decision. The Jolt Effect by Matt Dixon talks about this in the 
methodology, and since this is about to be the hottest book in the world since 
Challenger, I’ll highlight how closing works and tie it in.
J.  Judge the level of indecision. (Qualify)
O. Offer your recommendation. (FOMU - fear of messing up > FOMO)
L.  Limit the (customer) exploration. (Travel Agent analogy. Position as SME, so the   
     customer doesn’t feel the need for endless research)
T.  Take risk off the table. (Get creative on services, language, case studies, 
     start small, etc.)
What top Closers are doing is they are making it easy to buy. They are taking away 
the indecision of the prospect.
What was most intriguing watching Garrett come off of 10MM dollars of all matters of 
deals closing was he would command the room. He’d stand up at the whiteboard in 
the closing meeting and walk people through heavy concepts with a dry-erase marker, 
simplifying the complex elements of the deal and tech, almost like he was giving a 
TED Talk. This level of fearlessness, courage, and leadership is unusual.

He had a couple of other legendary quotes, which I’ll break down just to get you into 
the attitude and swagger of 7-figure closers:
“Break the chain; feel the pain.” I was always shocked when follow-up emails grew to 
over 2,000 words with links, screenshots, charts, case studies, white papers, and 
commentary.
“Entertainment as a thank you, not a pre-requisite.” The idea is that you don’t buy 
your prospects with gifts or bribes. The value is in doing the deal.
The other quote I love is, “The real gold is when you work with our CS team.” The 
idea here is no matter how good we get as sellers; all the value will always be most 
profoundly realized in using the software and experiencing the upside ROI first-hand 
by plugging it in.
Unlearning Advancement
Read Cal Newport’s work, and you’ll realize you have to be so good they can’t ignore 
you. (Steve Martin) But once you harness that career capital to be your best, your 
results protect you. “Pipeline cures all ills,” per Kraig Kleeman, and you will only rise 
as high as your mastery of “optics” and political savvy. If a rep crushes sales in the
woods, as they say—nobody knows about it.
I can’t tell you how many top reps never advance and are still ceiling
at 100/150K per year.
Unlearning Earning
Earning a massive living first hinges on a massive belief in yourself. You need to 
decide to “burn the ships,” as Tony Robbins loves to say. You must determine 


Codex XVII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
whether you’ll bank everything on “Justin Michael Incorporated” or “Some SaaS 
company.”
An obvious choice is if you had 30 days to save a company or a life or if you raised 
the stakes high enough. Think about it.
You are the CEO of your own life.
Your earning potential is directly tied to what you believe you can earn. You need 
three things to do this:
§  The more enigmatic, the higher the feª
  Be able to convince someone you can do something they can’t do and 
transaction (could be the product you sell/evangelize
  Instead of building bigger, better, faster nets, build a garden that attracts the 
butterflies. (Jack Canfield’s Law)
Unlearning Persuasion
We need to pick up where Cialdini left off. The polarity shift is the essence of sales. 
Make it their idea to do the transaction. Great sellers first create desire in the prospect.
There’s a magic moment in every sale or micro-transaction, like a first call where the 
magnetic poles shift, and you no longer push on a rope. The prospect is suddenly 
driving the deal. This can take 90 seconds, 90 days, or even nine months.
Unlearning Success
Your future is bright because you read this paper. I buried the hook of the alternate 
title: 5,000 words to earn you 5MM dollars.


Codex XVII

We overestimate what we can accomplish in one month and underestimate what we 
can achieve in a year. Benioff took it further; we overestimate what we can 
accomplish in one year and underestimate what we’ll do in ten.
The higher up you go, the better you must get at prospecting. It’s a paradox. 
Opening is the new closing. Many AEs, Directors, and VPs just want to retire from 
hunting. It’s the opposite. The lead wolf is in the back protecting the pack.

These tips are probably enough to give you an edge over the other 600,000 SDRs 
and 6,000,000 REPs sending boilerplate marketing emails with a personalized 
sentence that took you 4 hours total in the day to compose them all.
[ Unlearn everything you know about cold outreach — any rules of thumb or 
generally accepted best practices — forget them. You’re starting over.
[ Speak calmly and write casually — avoid being overly needy and deferential.
[ Coordinate touch points no more than two days apart until you get an answer.
[ Lead with the phone. If you connect, ask who’s in charge of whatever they are in 
charge of — Route. Ruin. Multiply.
[ If you get a voicemail, lead with your name and number. Tell them you have a 
relevant product available.
[ Email immediately after the first phone call. Reply to this email for the next two 
days if no answer. First reply bump: thoughts? Second: get creative with a 
diagram or GIF.
[ No more than 3 sentences in the email. Less if possible.
[ Only talk about pain — solution with customer example — CTA.
[ Assumptive but gentle CTA. Include tapout “If it makes sense, how’s your 
calendar?”.
[ After 3rd email, repeat this process again 2 days later with a different angle.
[ If you notice any multiple opens, profile views, forwarded messages: triple or 
quadruple down — call, voicemail, email, LinkedIn connect (Twitter, other social if 
applicable).
[ Do this with 3-5 people in the org at a time for C-level, VPs, directors.
[ If this doesn’t work after 2 weeks, swap or pivot to someone else in the org 
laterally.

Phone Tactics
Mindset “Hunter”
Most callers act naturally, waiting, wishing, and hoping the prospect will pick up or 
agree to a meeting. If I  just call enough, the thinking goes, I’ll get lucky. This is not 
the case. Effectual outbound calling is an  unnatural act. A hunter's mindset is that if 
anyone answers a call, I will prevail. How do you do it? Remaining  calm, relaxed, 
collected and controlling the call with active listening. The vast majority of phone 
techniques  are Kung Fu. I teach Aikido, where you use the opponent's force and 
power to roll or disarm them.
On Reverse Psychology
Many of you may have read Sandler or heard of the role of reverse psychology in 
sales. Then you wonder, how  do I apply it? As you read this guide, it’s the overarching 
theme. A pattern interrupt, by definition, is  something you are not expecting. In many 
ways, it’s Pavlovian or subliminal — it’s beneath the prospect’s conscious awareness. I 
once trained with the top Sandler Trainer in the world, and I asked him, “Can you sum  
this whole method up for me in one sentence?” He said, “Whatever you naturally want 
to do at any point in  the sales process, do the exact opposite.” Think about it. That 
decision-maker is getting hundreds of calls and  emails that look nearly identical. If you 
genuinely want to stand out, you must sound the opposite. Say the  opposite, intone 
the opposite, and write the opposite of the last 999 sellers.
Script Ideas
Note: I developed my opener juxtaposed to PBOs — “permission-based openers.”
I find it weak to ask  permission for anything. Ask forgiveness, not permission, and 
maintain equivalency (equal business stature—Sandler) with prospects.

Script 1:
Route Ruin Multiply (RRM) or RRR Route-Ruin-Rip (Codex VII & XIII)
ROUTE
Hey [say full name] —
Yeah, that’s me
Who’s in charge of your [discipline] strategy?
I am. Or, that rolls up to me.
Just curious how you currently achieve X (validate)
RUIN
If they say a competitor responds—validate, “Acme is great–how’s that working out for you?”
ß Peel the onion with SPIN questions (see below in this writeupÏ
ß Wait for the prospect’s Polarity Shift “wait, what do you do again?”
MULTIPLY
Why not plug us in alongside [Acme] to multiply the effectiveness of your current solution? 
RIP
Instead of carving out a straight-up beachhead pitch of your product here, hopefully, 
you are 2-5  minutes in for the “pitch later” framework to take root. The cardinal rule 
is don’t diss the competitor,  no badmouthing, no battle cards. Just focus on your 
solution’s differentiators and strengths here  because they’ve shown interest and 
asked. “Rip” was designed for IT scenarios or CRM SaaS  products; you can’t 
augment a stack; you have to rip out—so the “pitch later” frame still helps you.

Script 2:
Why You Why Now (Barrows BASHO derived)
Hey John, The reason for my call is [insert relevant UVP]
Warning: You get hella objections here, so you need to be ready for combat. RRM was built to 
flank this,  although it’s still a good full frontal assault: some analytical buyers will hook from the 
front with a badass  Mad Men-level pitch. It can take years to perfect, so many old-school cold 
callers still swear by it. Why work  so hard? Use RRM and RRR.
Script 3:
Hey Bill, Justin Michael from Acme Corp, Can I get just 27 seconds of your time…
Note: This is a pattern interrupt because you’re reducing the friction of a time commitment; the 
risk is a  product can sound cheap if you can explain it in under 30 seconds. (ConnectAndSell 
loves this one—it’s  Sandler & Voss derived).
Script 4:
Hey John, this is a cold call. I’m sure I hate making them as much as you hate 
getting them….
Prospect laughs… Sandler humor script.

AVQ:
Acknowledge (that's a great question, I understand you think this won't work for you). 
Value (give a value  prop that directly counters the objection with feature and benefit) 
and Question (end with a question that is a  call to action).
I love this frame for handling social media comments. Hence, it provokes, and you 
get more  comments.
Overcoming Objections
The most crucial aspect of objections is determining whether it’s an actual objection or 
a comment. Are they  just stating an issue, or do they object? You can quickly ignore or 
handle a comment; a real objection  indicates that you’ve missed something in your 
sales process. I’ll list the most common rebuttals here  because objections are 
inevitable but first, I wanted to hit on the philosophical underpinnings of why you’re 
getting so many. If you use old-school phone approaches that interrupt to persuade, 
convince, and  “outsmart” prospects, they’ll put up blockades, smoke screens, brush-
offs, lie, and even take meetings to  deep-six you. 
See Codex XIV (Ack-Peel) for the top 50 objections per HubSpot.
Rebuttals
Not interested
Well, how do you know you’re not interested when 
you haven’t even let me tell you what this is about?

No worries, why not visit with me anyway. I promise 
to share trends, strategies, and insights. (Weinberg)
••• 
Send me some information
Frankly, in years of making these calls, I’ve never 
once sent information to that person. Is there 
something  you’d like to learn about our product/
service? Why not visit with us anyway; we promise 
to add value and  share ideas. (h/t Weinberg)
Sales Psychology
There is no such thing as a sale that isn’t strategic. Human beings are political animals. 
You’re dealing with  persuasion, neuroscience, emotion (bucking bronco), and many 
factors beyond your control on a phone call.  There is also no such thing as a “dumb” 
prospect. Always assume the human on the other end is intelligent.  Our brains are 
millions of years old, and this incarnation is 40,000 years—nothing new in the brain 
from  1922 to 2022. Your prospect can smell BS from a mile away, tell if you’re nervous, 
lacking confidence, trying  to trick them, or something is “off” even if they can’t put 
their finger on it.
Tonality
80% of a phone call is your tone. The old school is confidence and power poses which 
is fine, but if you’re  like me, that gets exhausting. The tone I take is called The DMV 
Approach or Air Traffic Control. Usually, when  I am doing cold-calling exhibitions on

Discord, audiences are shocked when I’m talking calmly and some  powerful CRO is 
doing backflips like a puppet on a string. Because I am in a rhythm based on how I’m 
asking  the questions.
You need to sound trustworthy. Do you trust super loud, aggressive salespeople like 
Grant Cardone? (he’s  entertaining!) Do you trust someone that is depressed or checked 
out? Extreme emotions are off-putting to  callers. Also, that “Movie Phone” voice doesn’t 
work. How do you sound when you are relaxed and in your  authentic tone? You want to 
eliminate “err and umm, like'' and try to be economical with what you say.
Focus on asking questions and getting the prospect to talk 95% of the time. I’ve run 
scripts complete  monotone and out-performed “naturals” or peppy callers up toning 
and throwing the reins (horse kicks you  off and gallops to the barn!)
Downtones
You must NOT be up toning all over the calls. You need to learn to ask a question but 
make it a statement, so  the tone goes down at the end. The common theme is that 
you’re training yourself to do unnatural acts.
When I train reps, they have many issues with objections, can’t close for time (the 
first close per Iannarino),  and exhibit problems downstream in the script. I take them 
back to the first 3-7 seconds and find up tones, stammers, and all manner of 
problems, even as simple as heavy breathing. The best way to open a cold call is  to 
state their full name (Dale Carnegie), even if you pronounce it wrong. You need to be 
recording and  listening to your calls. Leave tailored voicemails and hit the # button to 
listen back; record several per  prospect ‘til you’re smooth. (fast hack!)

Diffusing Frustration
Emotions are wild. You NEVER want to be more emotional than a prospect on the 
phone. The best way to deal  with an angry person? Let them get angrier. Listen and 
let them vent. Even pull the phone back. You want to  face the blowtorch and let the 
hot air out of the balloon. This is why listening with high curiosity diffuses  friction and 
lowers prospect resistance (Bosworth). Saying things like, “That’s fine, I totally 
understand,  makes sense.” Agreeing with Prospects is a lethal weapon—very few 
sellers ever do it. RRM is designed to  lower prospect resistance, friction, or Braun 
Zone of Resistance (ZOR), so it can be their idea to let you pitch.  Create the desire in 
them (always step one).

to do but  probably the biggest game changer (The Gong studies don’t show this 
because few sellers ever do it) ¢
¢ Don’t ask for the meeting—let them speak for 2-5 minutes ¢
¢ Pitch at the end of the call ¢

deeper from symptoms into problems.

Active listening
What does it mean to you to truly listen? Because you now have a framework like 
Route-Ruin-Multiply, you  can free up your attention to just listen. Most cold callers are 
so caught up in what they’ll say next, or they’re  arguing so much they’re actively 
dodging the bullet of the “hang up.” Genuine curiosity is selfless and  other-oriented. 
It’s an intention prospects can sense and feel. Care about what a prospect thinks and 
seek to  understand their business. Truly. Detach from the outcome of booking the 
meeting and put your total focus  on their words, and get real answers to your queries.
Questioning Frameworks
The top questioning frameworks in my eyes are Sandler Pain Funnel or SPIN Questions.
SPIN
Situation Problem Implication Need-Payoff
­ Most cold callers live in situations and problems; they identify pain, match their 
solution to it, and seek a meeting.²
­ Implication and Need-Payoff are more subtle. You would assume that when you 
ask a prospect,  “what’s keeping you up at night?” they’d know, but this question 
doesn’t work anymore.²
­ Latent pain is under the surface, insidious, and arising later. If someone says, “Our 
vendor’s  customer service sucks…” The natural response is, “No problem; ours is 
better.” Implication  questions would sound like, “What would happen if you don’t 
fix your customer service problem?”...  Need-payoff would be, “If you fix your CS 
problem, what are the implications on revenue growth?” In  essence, if you solve 
that pain, how does it pay off.²
­ No pain, no sale—you need to be asking, “what are the implications if you don’t 
fix this problem?” / If you do fix this problem, how does it pay off for you 
(financially, politically, etc.)

Peeling the Onion—Tip of the Iceberg
Q Prospects can’t see under the surface of their business. You need to be like a 
doctor or detective to  diagnose and sleuth out what’s going on.T
Q Whenever a prospect tells me a problem, I assume it’s a symptom and keep 
digging. This could be  asking the 5 Whys, why over and over again. It could be 
using SPIN questions as above. “When did  that start?”, “How have you tried to 
solve this before?” This is where Sandler Pain Funnel comes in  (see diagram).
The Iceberg of Ignorance – A visual summary of the findings from Sidney Yoshida’s research.
Q Only 4% of problems are 
known to top managers
Q 9% of problems are known 
to middle management
Q 74% of problems are 
known to supervisors
Q 100% of problems are known 
to front-line employees
Q 96% of problems are not 
known to top managers

Manual Tracking
ABSD TRACKER
Use a manual tracker like my signature above—please make a copy—(Monday.com, 
Airbase, Trello) to ensure  you’re mapping your top 200 accounts, slicing them to 40 
VIPs, and tripling 3-7 stakeholders a piece.  Use a legal pad and cross hatches (not 
kidding, low TQ, low tech still never fails—Day-Timer anyone? LOL)
Stack rank this 4, 3, 2, 1, 0—color code it. 
Another very effective use of the 80/20 rule.
Dialing on Signals
ß Prospect ads you—TRIPLEÖ
ß Prospect views your profile—TRIPLEÖ
ß Prospect opens an email over three times—TRIPLEÖ
ß Prospect comments on an open thread or tweets relevantly 
to your product—TRIPLE (tailor it to the  comment thread)
Note: Mention the signal you saw on the outreach, “Hey Susie, noticed you opened my email 
27 times.  Shouldn’t we discuss it?”

Time Blocking
Set aside the shoulders of the day . 1 hour at 8 am and 4 pm to do an hour block of 
outbound calling.  Emphasis on personalized voicemails to get a 3X return on emails. 
Try batch processing your emails; aka, don’t answer any of them the first hour.  Shut off 
your chats and slacks, even put a sign on the door that you’re prospecting, then drop 
as many VMs as  you can in 30-45 minute intervals in a couple of sessions every day.

Polarity Shifting
\ Definition of a polarity shift: that magic moment in a deal where the prospect 
drives the sale or call. I  invented, rather discovered, this phenomenon.U
\ How did I find it? Over a full Enterprise Sales cycle (Strategic) / Solution sale, this 
is this magic moment  when your champion starts to drive the deal, but I noticed a 
mini or microcosm polar shift inside prospecting  calls Z
\ On an RRM call, this is the moment the prospect takes interest, “Wait, what’s [your 
product or service]?  What do you do again?” Once this polarity shifts, you gain an 
edge to lever the deal forward and gain  momentum. Don’t react if they do it in the 
first 3 seconds; that’s a red herring polar shift (brushoff)—it  needs to happen later 
once you’ve lowered prospecting resistance via active listening.
Reference: Codex VII, XII & XIII (DM for this)
Z Once you agree to the meeting, don't ask "who else should be on the call?" too 
salesy—"Who else would be interested in seeing this?", "Who else is working on 
the KPIs you're looking at here?" Z
§Z Once the meeting is booked, email a question or two that gives more pain and 
get them to say "I  don't know" and "In that case, why don't you bring on a 
colleague."U
Z Contact other people and mention you have the call to grow the discovery call 
audience Z
Z Always add agendas to first calls that look like this in the GCal invite 
¼Z Acme Challenges and Strategic ObjectivesU
Z Acme custom solution overviewU
ÀZ Q&
´Z ?U
¨Z Two days before sending the Agenda, ask for #4—they may say, “tell us about 
Deloitte or how this  integrates with our ERP.”U
Z Update the GCal—you get an excuse to ping everyone with another reminder 
calendar email. 
Obviously, Chili Piper is the best solution for this; incredible UI and sends 
automated reminder  pings.

Cialdini Influence
Reciprosity
Commitment
Social Proof
Authority
Liking
Scarcity
Unity
© Robert Cialdini
Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Dr. Robert Cialdini  is required reading—
this one and The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch sat on my desk far too long (like 
five  years!) Here’s how I’m using key elements for outbound.
 Reciprocity—give to get—do a favor like help the prospect network with a key 
target. Outright gifting can  be seen as slimy, so be careful even though this is 
popular. Think of entertainment as a “thank you” vs. prerequisite.
 Congruence/Commitment—someone says they’ll meet with you on Thursday and 
doesn’t write or leave this  vmail, “Jane, you stated you’d be available at 3 pm 
Thursday, what’d I miss?” Oddly, they feel guilt and will  usually apologize and 
reschedule. They want to act congruently with civility. I use the break-up email, 
“Can  you please have the courtesy to point me to the appropriate person who 
handles _ mobile growth strategy?
 Authority—Calling very high at the C-Level, Board, or VC-level and getting 
delegated down.
 Scarcity—“We’re working with select clients.” Reverse: “Maybe you’re not ready 
for an Enterprise-level  commitment.” (Negotiations or if they say, “not interested”)
 Social Proof—The 800 lb. gorilla of influence, a relevant customer or direct 
competitor to create FOMO.

Results & Rave Reviews
Keenan Yoseph
I’ve never had a sequence that booked me meetings. I only had luck with one off hyper-
personalized touches. I created industry specific sequences and modeled my approach 100% after 
the JMM and went from booking 0 meetings through sequence to booking 2-3 per week. My open 
rates are 82-100% and average around 90%. Some of my reply rates are double digits. I’ve only 
put 51 prospects through the sequence since creating them 2 weeks ago. This is just my first 
iteration. I cannot imagine what happens as I continue to optimize.
Luke Ruffing
Justin's approach to prospecting has not only revolutionized my personal pipeline (14 cold 
outbound meetings) in less than 2 weeks using the JMM (Justin Michael Method). But he has also 
managed to build an incredible community that I look to outside of work for life advice. Incredible 
work Justin! Keep it up. 

Justin is a classic example of showing how much you care before showing how much you know. 
Scott Frymire
I've hired Justin to work with my BDR teams at two different companies. He is great with the reps! 
He doesn't just tell them what they should be doing, he actually gets involved in their daily 
activities, helping them with their scripts, emails, objection handling, personalization of message, 
etc. His method works. At both companies, we saw a definite uptick in the number of qualified 
outbound leads per week. I'd definitely recommend Justin to any company looking to level up their 
BDR game. Even if you have a BDR manager in place, Justin can complement that person with his 
real world experience and daily "strength training" of the team.

A Faux Pas
Avoiding Generic Outreach
As I’m reviewing the outreach that I receive, one factor becomes abundantly clear:
The vast majority of what sellers are sending in email is far too generic.
So let’s break down some examples that illustrate the problem in real messages
that I received:
Hi Justin, I hope you’re doing well. How are you adjusting to the new normal? 
[fully generic — “new normal” is played out]
Hi Justin, Thank you for connecting with me here on LinkedIn. Here is
something I ask you to consider... As a small business owner chances are you
probably are overpaying your taxes. [I’m not an SMB]
Hi Justin, looks like we have some mutual connections in common, would you 
be open to connecting and networking? [generic, vague — template]
Dear Justin I found your profile while searching for fellow professionals
to connect with. I hope you would like to connect too. [dear? super formal —

Transpose
From Generic to Specific
I know we’re not trying to put a bunch of sellers on blast but these templates are 
either generic, vague or miss the mark.
There is zero level of personalization, relevance, or context and it’s just slovenly.
Sales malpractice.
This is being weaponized with new semi-automated systems and I am receiving 
often a dozen a day.
To get flagrant, I often get the wrong name in the email, or an email that’s totally 
irrelevant — like even written for another persona and clearly, the automation failed.
So, how do we fix it and be better?
The answer is this...
The right combination of Personalization, Relevance, and Timing.
Music that moves you combines — or synthesizes (transposes) — specific 
combinations of instruments at the right time and the right pacing to generate its 
powerful effect. And what is that?
It moves you — it speaks to you.
Similarly, we want our emails to truly speak to our prospects.
So we Personalize, make Relevant, and make Timely, with specificity.

Specificity
Personalization x Relevance
When we're messaging our prospects, being purposefully specific with key data 
points brings personalization into the realm of relevance.
It gives your ROI claims context.
And establishes credibility, allowing us to truly speak to our prospects.
Ô Be extra specific. I see we both know {{Connection.Name}} –––> add exactly 
how! Did you work at the same company, attend the same school, met at an 
event, did some fun project together©
Ô Mention something ultra-relevant — I notice that you have a certification in 
Project Management, did you know that Project Managers find these specific 
aspects of the platform relevant because it drives value©
Ô Drive into specific use cases: We worked with another similar FinTech client 
(name them!) to reduce their software costs by 30% by deploying K8s for edge 
computing vs. we save similar clients money. Which specific client, which specific 
business outcome, which method of getting there — what is the exact use case©
Ô Prospects will call BS on the generic and the vague. Don’t use 4,000 — use 
4,128. Hyper, laser-specific is the key. Don’t round the numbers to 20% ROI. If it’s 
22.56, there’s a much higher chance of catching their attention.

Synthesis
Tying Specifics Together
Synthesis brings insight immediately through transposition and integration of 
your well-researched, specific data points.
As you prepare to write your cold email and are studying your target company, note 
its recent funding round, then go read about its technology, then its culture, so you 
could make this statement quite confidently — and specifically tying all your insights 
together.
So what we do when we synthesize is not unlike machine learning algorithms. We 
are going to create a pattern and overlay to mash up several specific insights/
concepts into a value narrative.
¾º Recent news about business growth — revenue, tech innovationº
¨º M&A of an adjacent technologyº
º Politics — people moving around, requisitions, sudden leaving of an exec. List the 
three disparate ideas and then transpose them into a single story as follows.
Synthesizing blended or stacked insights and then positioning your product or 
solution alongside takes your personalization and makes it relevant. 
You really should try to weave multiple nuggets into an Insight Stack, synthesize a 
greater insight from the blend. Predict the future, read the tea leaves, consider the 
implications, find your silver linings playbook. Why does this work? It proves YOU a 
seller, actually tried to understand my business. If you did you’d know the interplay of 
all these market movements extrinsically and intrinsically, it’s OK. When you assume 
from an informed position you gain massive credibility even if you assume wrong. 
The danger is gross negligence, not synthesizing your research at all, not even 
trying.

Examples
Battle-Tested Templates
Again, tying your insights together into one personalized, relevant, and timely 
narrative cuts through the clutter and shows your prospect that you're speaking to 
THEM and not a faceless list of generic ICPs based on some random email list you 
scraped the day before. Take these, for example:
Hey Gabi – I noticed your recent job change and move from the New York to 
Chicago office to open it. It’s really interesting because with the boom of
e-Commerce in CPG resources are consolidating to Chicago and online. You 
mentioned the need for better data governance as a 90% brick-in-mortar 
operation moves nearly 100% into the cloud. Our technology can accelerate the 
momentum of a secure operating environment in the new paradigm. Your 
competitor Huge Max Retail deployed our tech and was able to get to 
compliance 5X faster.
Orson – I read about your financial forecasting tool that’s the most accurate in 
the world – consumers just love it 4.3 stars online. I was impressed to see the 
resultant revenue jump of 245% to 3.1B. This allowed you to pick up LaserBox 
Automation which allows you to now automate even more processes in your 
core tech. What I’m really curious is about why Ryan Reynolds stepped down. 
What is the plan to take the direction of the business into hypergrowth? We 
have a recruiting suite that can fill hypertechnical roles especially when there
are leadership changes and tight timelines.

John – Clearly, based on raising 30MM Series C, your idea to identify light-
conducting polymers that are biomarkers for cancer prevention research with 
infrared light was viable. I’m not surprised, based on the spirit of extolling 
innovation that Big Hulking Pharma has displayed since 1997.
The truth is that the top data points on companies are typically all interrelated. Take 
TikTok...
It would seem that regulations with the Chinese, has driven you to bake off 
your US operations, which turned into a global bidding war, and you’re

need specialized HR and Severance Package planning depending on 
rightsizing after the cuts.
There is a pandemic in Email Land of a simple statement that is an informed thought 
masquerading as if it were a synthesized insight. It is not. “Prospect, I see your

synthesis, there is no insight generated really. vs. the following:

Effort
Do or Do Not — There is No Try
Why does synthesizing with specifics work?
It proves YOU a seller, actually tried to understand my business.
When you assume from an informed position you gain massive credibility even if 
you assume wrong. The danger is gross negligence, not synthesizing your research 
at all, not even trying.
Obviously, do your research and truly try to dig for some actionable insights.
Again, if you're off by a hair — no problem. It's the effort that counts — and 
sometimes that will get you the reply rather than the accuracy of the content itself. 
Go figure.
So go out there.
Google, Bing, LinkedIn, your horoscope, whatever you use to research — create 
some insight stacks and watch your inbox flood with responses.
The rest is up to you ;)

The 3-cluster
Email Sequence


Codex IX

salesborgs.ai
A Brief Note
This is the exact sequence template I use across clients and it is plug and play.
It works (for the most part) every time.
There are not that many people using this and you’ll stand out in the inbox. I haven’t 
made a sequence like this public just yet, though many of the guides and Codex pdfs 
hint towards something like this.
A bump email is in reply to the original subject line.
So each cluster has a main email and two bumps that go with it.
The bumps are quite flexible; this is just a sample.
The concept is to maximize the propensity for the original message to be 
consumed. You’re getting to open another loot box every time it gets bumped. 
That’s why the bump messages are sparse, I’m directing them back to the original 
message in the thread.
Your open rates on the main spears will go through the roof this way.
By the way, a “spear” is simply a short, compact 3 or 4 line email that focuses on 
customer outcomes, social proof, and conversational but professional and 
authoritative language.

The Venn diagram should also be the first or second bump email on your first spear 
in the cluster. You should even vary this as you’re firing. Maybe every other contact 
gets thoughts first, with the alternates getting Venns first.
This means if they had been opening your emails, they saw this thing already.
Suddenly, their friends at work are getting blasted with it.
I'm trying to get them to talk to each other about me.

Boom
Cracking target accounts
The problem I have a unique ability to solve (paired with the rare willingness to 
share) is how to proceed when you have a limited patch, territory, or named account 
list, and you must gain access.
Opening new business in a target account is a mythical skill.
Your CRO and VP of Sales will know who you are if you're a reliable safecracker. 
Opening a mega-deal at an enterprise account is probably just as hard as closing 
one. But there are many closers and not very many specialists who can do this.
Of course, there’s social selling and strategic calling.
Kyle Porter the other day mentioned how if he were trying to get into a named 
account, he would call low in the org, build a case for himself and then take his 
findings to the C-level, sharing with them insight about their business they didn't 
know before.
This is completely accurate. But somewhere along the way, you're going to hit a 
patch where you don't have the phone numbers, not even a direct dial company 
number (it seems like a lot of places don't even do this anymore), the job titles are 
obfuscated, and there are no social media profiles to be found. Legend has it that 
Facebook does not permit employees to talk about their job. You'd have to imagine


a similar policy at many F100 companies. There's no strategic advantage to sharing 
who does what; if anything, it would give the competition too much information.
The Hit List
Making a list — the right way
So you pick up a list of 10 accounts. 
You must get in.
You’re selling some kind of obscure software that is not in the marketing or sales 
realm; it’s something technical. You might be going after network engineers, AI / ML 
leaders, or risk management titles. After checking every database, all you have is a 
guess of an email address for your desired targets.
How do you proceed?
The first thing I'd do is build a list in Sales Navigator. Go into the account and start 
getting slick with your boolean searches.
Boolean operators: AND, NOT, OR
You're going to want about 30 potential stakeholders.
Get granular and look at job descriptions in the Jobs section on LinkedIn. The 
recruiting department was nice enough to use internal language to describe 
functions. It does not have to be just job titles you're searching. The body of their 
profile might have a snippet that reveals who you're looking for.
Sure — we're on LinkedIn, so you should probably go ahead and try to connect with 
these folks and spend your InMail credits, but ultimately let's imagine they're ghosts 
online and you're not going to find them on LinkedIn. I highly recommend sending 
the InMails anyway because it pings the email address they signed up with (usually a

personal email). Even if it's a work email, your name is showing up in their life a few 
extra times.
Pull the Pin
Implementation
I ran this as a manual process, but you're certainly open to using a sequencer. 
However, ENT mail servers are smarter than the average bear and may block your 
mainstream pixel trackers.
y Pick the top 5-8 likely targets and make sure, if you're running manual, you have 
open tracking software, like Yesware, installed over your outbox^
y Run the JMM cluster sequence: day 1 email, day 2 bump, day 3 bump with calls 
every other day on all contacts. After the 2nd cluster, or even after the first bump 
of the second cluster, look back at whether they’re opening your email or not^
y If they are NOT opening your emails, swap them out for another person off the 
list during cluster 2. If they are opening (especially high opens, 3+), go to their 
LinkedIn page again and look at the "people also viewed" list on the right^
y Start hitting those people both on LinkedIn and with emails.
In the email, it's an easy one-liner:
Who's in charge of risk management, 
does [Prospect] head that up?
And include the Venn diagram. I haven't talked about the Venns yet, but here:
Codex VIII

The Venn diagram should also be the first or second bump email on your first spear

This means if they had been opening your emails, they saw this thing already.
Suddenly, their friends at work are getting blasted with it. I'm trying to get them 
to talk to each other about me.


Aftermath
Seeing results
If you continue this exact pattern relentlessly, the account will open.
Your emails must be short and to the point, bounce to the top of their inbox every 24 
hours, and be outcome-oriented. I'll make a separate post about how I'm 
personalizing those emails.
But it's not deep and doesn't take me a long time. Quick version:
 Does the prospect know anyone I knows
k Does the prospect have a work history with any of my clientss
m Recent media, social media, blog content authored by the prospect.
Consider this a reimagination of Personalization at Scale. A “Personalization 
Evangelist” trainer advocated for prospect authored content as the most important. 
The only problem is that there’s a narrow set of prospects who author content 
unless you’re selling to sales and marketing. The rest of their 5 buckets have shown 
diminishing returns in extensive A/B testing. The original personalization scheme 
also omits referrals and work history, both major relevance levers.
So think about it — this will get you some kind of an answer. It might not be a yes, 
but at some point, they have to turn off the crop circles forming in their email server. 
Please don't write to me saying, "isn’t this going to be annoying" because no, it's not. 
No exec is ever frustrated with getting too many emails about a way to make more 
money or solve a problem they're trying to figure out.
There you have it.
PS: Find Codex 5, it shows the personalization strategy in more detail.

Phonistry:
Sophisticated Systems 


Codex XVI
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
Introduction
The psychology of the phone has been vastly oversimplified. The majority of 
outbound phone techniques are fatally flawed. The spotlight is on the rep, whilst it 
needs to be on the prospect to impinge. Get my Route-Route-Multiply (RRM) and 
Route-Ruin-Rip (RRR) frameworks if you haven’t explored this topic in full / road-
tested it.
When a phone technique transfers power to the prospect (Alpha), it marginalizes the 
seller (rendering them Beta). We call this “swipe left.” There are a vast array of 
mindsets, skillsets, and methods to reverse this polarity. I’ve touched upon it in some 
of my seminal work but this paper is designed to go deeper into the esoteric realm 
that I take in my team training. So much is missed in a simple RRM guide to 
encapsulate 20 years and 20K hours grinding on phones — so here we will dive into 
the deeper, philosophic meaning and intent of the advanced phone techniques.
Inherent Power Dynamics
Decision-makers are high alpha operators. They are used to being courted. I knew a
prospect that once received a Fender electric guitar, and has been frequently 
offered an all-expenses-paid vacation to the Swiss Alps. I spoke about this in the 
book Combo Prospecting.
We need a whole new calculus to take someone desired and flip the polarity to
make them desire us, or our solution. People don’t buy products. They buy you. They 
actually buy (emotionally) based on the experience with the seller and justify with 
logic. I think I was one of the first people in the industry to apply elements of pickup 
artistry to prospects. The entire idea of “negging” a C-Level executive in the top 
script is nowhere - yet if you think about it, it’s a subtle slice of genius. What’s the 
most refreshing thing you can do with the powerful? Not bow down, supplicate. Point

out a flaw. I speak at great length about Principled Disinterest and the Law of Non-
Hunger in “Combo Prospecting” and “Tech-Powered Sales.” Words like “love” show 
far too much enthusiasm and can repel. You need to maintain calm — I call this Air 
Traffic Control or The DMV Approach.
Sophisticated Call Anatomy
If you’re reading this, you’re inside one of my Mastermind Groups (WhatsApp/
Discord — just DM me). You’ve no doubt read “Combo Prospecting” and my guides. 
All prospects are disinterested and “all set.” They all use a competitor and are just 
fine with the status quo. The Justin Michael Method in every incarnation is designed 
as an art form that meets science. Every massive deal I ever opened or closed 
started out with “not interested.” I don’t look for low-hanging fruit. I create demand, I 
don’t service it. I trigger sales cycles, I don’t wait for the 3% of the market already 
inside the buying window.
Alphas & Betas


Codex XVI
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
If you’re talking to prospects that are nice, you’re not calling in high enough. 
Decision-makers are elusive, salty, and hard to get to. These folks are a unique 
breed, “D” is for Dominance in DISC. They control the P&L and they can put you on 
“burn notice” in the account. Nearly every prospect system would have you believe if 
you interrupt them and are logical enough, persuasive enough, they will submit, stay 
on the line, and book a demo. It’s not how it works at all. To control a powerful 
decision-maker takes active listening. What I’ve started to train reps on is deftly 
placing open-ended questions upfront and moving into a SPIN selling motion from 
the outset of the call. If two alphas meet, you suddenly have a game of chicken. 
Locked horns! Polarity can’t match. Two positive magnets repel. What's the solution? 
You control Alpha energy by feigning Beta. This is like playing possum where the 
animal pretends to be dead. Fall on your sword of Damocles. You will notice on my 
calls, I’m incredibly soft-spoken because the tone is not how I’m controlling the call. 
They don’t care about me or the product. I’m guiding them to talk about themselves 
(only!) and to go higher Alpha but then I’m the puppeteer in effect.
Powershifting — Social Aikido / Social Tai-chi


Codex XVI
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
A sale can only occur when ‘the pain of the same is greater than the pain of change” 
(to paraphrase Brent Adamson in Challenger Sale). Nearly every phone framework is 
a) interrupt b) persuade c) handle objections rebuttals. “The reason for my call.” “I 
don’t care,” thinks every prospect viscerally. It can’t work because you’re causing a 
reflexive recoil. You’re literally triggering the amygdala “fight or flight.” The prospect 
had to accept their stack in the JD. They have a vested interest to protect the 
incumbent’s solution in place. You can’t come in swinging because they’ll just defend 
and justify digging their heels in further even if your solution is superior. I realized 
early on that calling powerful people and listening to them about “why” they’re so 
powerful or smart is the most disarming thing I can do. They don’t want to talk to a 
seller/vendor and they certainly don’t want to talk about you. WIFM - what’s in it for 
them? Validate their status quo. It dismantles them. Oh how the mighty fall! “You 
don’t seem like a salesperson, you seem like a friend,” CEOs bemusedly remark. 
“You know, I wasn’t going to keep talking with you initially but I think I’ll recommend 
you to my friend John at Beta Corp.” The verbatim line I always hear. “Honestly, I 
never take calls like this but I actually like you.” Nobody listens to them in this life. 
Not even their spouse or kids, trust me! Their locus of control? Minimal… Probably 
just that P&L so embolden them to flex their power. Then you can Judo roll them
Political Selling
Believe it or not, prospects don’t buy because the product is great (FFAB — features,
function, and benefits). They don’t buy because you differentiated against the
competitor (Compete Selling). They actually buy for optics. They want to look like a 
hero in the eyes of their boss so they get promoted. The peak selling stage after this 
level is trusted advisor. Hunters always search for elusive insights to become the 
vaunted “trusted advisor” and spend an inordinate amount of time on needless 
research to impress, when it's really quite simple. Help your prospect get promoted. 
Ask questions about their career advancement goals, in the top script of the call after

the RUIN step of  Route Ruin Multiply. “Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years?” 
Customers buy products and services to “look like a hero” so they’ll get promoted in 
their company. Politics is the ultimate driver — yet is it not talked about in a single 
sales book. Ever!
Symptoms vs. Problems
Every prospect is like an iceberg. You can try to identify pain - but you’ll normally hit a
symptom, not a true problem. We talk a great deal about peeling the onion. Problems
happen in chains. Getting to the bottom of a real problem takes some serious
detective-doctor work. For example, our SDR team can’t set meetings. “OK, why?” 
“Oh, well the CFO cut funding so we use a team that doesn’t even make cold calls 
and relies on email only.” “But why?” “Because we hired a phone team and they 
failed in ‘92.” See my point? Back to my point that nobody buys anything. Prospects

typically get moved to change based on “latent pain.” I love this word so much I 
pulled it from the annals of Solution Selling. Let's define it:
Latent is an adjective that you use to describe something that is capable of 
becoming active or at hand, though it is not currently so. The adjective latent is a 
tricky word to define because it refers to something there but not there.
Prospects “never knew what they always wanted.” It’s a pure Steve Jobs iPhone 
moment. Steve Ballmer was sure Apple would fail. A phenomenal seller can lead the 
prospect to a better understanding of themselves. The exercise of asking open SPIN 
questions — especially the (I)mplication / (N)eed-payoff , running a pain funnel, or 
peeling the onion allows the prospect to at least articulate what’s wrong. The truth 
about selling disruptive solutions is it’s rare a prospect wakes up one morning 
knowing they need your solution. Examples: What happens if you don’t make this 
change? (I) What is the upside if you fix it? (N)
Breaking the Fourth Wall
In the days of Shakespeare, “breaking the fourth wall” meant the actors turned to the
audience and opined on the scene. I use this technique all the time when I get shut 
down during a cold call. “Not interested, we’re all set.” “Oh I’m sorry, I was trying to 
sell this thing to you — can we hit pause. How could I have done this call better?” 
People love to give opinions so the best way to keep a disinterested prospect 
engaged is to say, “Hey just out of courtesy, can I get your opinion? How could I have 
positioned this product to you better?” Break the fourth wall if you get wedged.
The Mindset
You need to transition from waiting, wishing, and hoping you’ll set a meeting to 
becoming the most venomous snake in the Australian outback. A fully causal 
mentality means, “if this prospect picks up, I will get the referral, sale, and/or even 


Codex XVI

close.” I joke about this but a prospect can only make one primary mistake when 
facing me, “answering the phone.” That’s how confident I am in my skill on a phone. If 
you talk with me, I will prevail. You need to be the apex predator, the peak of the 
food chain. Imagine a great white shark fully breaching the sea level and grabbing a 
sea lion.
You can’t approach calls subserviently. Your entire goal is to get the prospect talking 
and keep them talking with open-ended SPIN questions for 2-15 minutes. Talk ratio 
should be 95% them / 5% you. Gong has never even analyzed a ratio like this 
because Route-Ruin-Mutiply is so revolutionary as a “pitch-later” framework — first 
ever since 2002 when SaaS began and Salesforce / Cisco each had a 50MM run 
rate.
Advanced Phone Strategies
When I’m on a cold call, I’m doing all sorts of pattern interrupts. I learned from a 
master Sandler Trainer with 20 years at Oracle that the main meta-philosophy is. 
"Whatever a prospect does or is expecting, do the opposite". If a prospect throws a 
curveball at me — you’ve heard me on demos — I spin it back. “I’m not interested.” 


Codex XVI
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
“How do you know? I haven’t told you why I called yet.” “Send me more information.” 
“Honestly, I would but the last 50 times I did that, I never spoke to that person for the 
rest of my life…. So is that what you’re insinuating?” Get off the script, off the beaten 
path, and improvise fearlessly. The worst thing that can happen is they hang up the 
phone.
I just want to pay homage to the intrepid Chris Rocas who did a Facetime Drop on
C-Levels which is batshit insane — can you even imagine, just dropping into the 
private life of a CXO? Brandon Bornancin of Seamless.ai claims to have replicated. If 
you are bold enough, you can get a hall pass! Fortune indeed favors the bold when it 
comes to prospecting stunts.
Voicemails
A voicemail should be left on every call and in one breath. Why? Because it spikes 
open rates on emails and InMails. Practice taking a deep breath and leaving the 
entire thing in one fell swoop. Make sure your voice goes down at the end 
(downtone). Never ask for a callback. I personally never do VM drops. I like to leave 
the smallest bit of personalization but make it relevant. Don’t bow down and fawn 
over all their awards and accomplishments. Mention something like a quote in a 
publication (it was legendary getting the CMO of Marriott to meet from a quote in 
Wired Magazine), call out a skill tag on their profile (Six Sigma Green Belt), or 
something relevant to your product – tie it back. “I notice you have a certification in 
Project Management” which could be a relevant fit for leveraging our process mining

down to who you sound like per Tony Hughes so reach for the stars and you just 
might hit a mountain. The top two mistakes I see in phone teams are 1) not calling in 
high enough 2) Assuming that friendly, easy-to-talk-to people can buy. I love salty 
prospects, ones that dodge me and hang up. The big money is in the deepwater with 
the fewest fish (Call me Ismael!). You need to target super senior prospects in the 
company and get used to live fire with them. My real secret here is I wait until I feel a 
little fear in the pit of my stomach and then I call that one.
Greatest real-life story here. I think it was Toshiba one of these Super Evil Mega Corp 
concerns. I pinged a Board Member on Sales Navigator with an InMail then hit his 
cell. He pinged back in minutes, called my desk. He set a full board room meeting 
the next week with his entire C-Suite. One cell phone call at the Board Level of a 
major Fortune 2,000 company. No guts no glory. Wingsuit base jumping only.
Trade Secrets
I obviously can’t capture 20 years of phone work and 20,000 hours of grinding into 
anyone’s playbook. I’ve studied everything — including relationship dynamics and
Dr. Robert Cialdini — to crack top-funnel calling. I have sat inside my own CEO’s 
LinkedIn profile on many occasions. I have called the same phone number 50 days 
in a row and left a VM every time.
To analyze my phone style here are some random pointers.
è Tonality: I’m completely calm, cool, collected and matter of facó
è Humor: I never take myself seriously - cracking wise the entire call (de-stresses itÃ
è Finesse: Don’t ever give the prospect the satisfaction of knowing it’s a script. 
Inherently easy, if you just follow Route Ruin Multiplyí
è Pattern Interrupts: I start the script with an open question. I validate the 
competitors. I ask career-oriented questions. I ask prospects to sign an MNDA 
even before they talk with me so they are comfortable being as forthcoming as

J Buy Cell Phone Data: Test every possible source be it CloudLead, SalesIntel, or 
LeadIQ. You are going to need direct dials (cell phones!) and it doesn’t matter 
how expensive they are. It unlocks the entire techniquet
J Multithreading: Reps are nowhere near assertive enough for this. You need to be 
directly calling 3-5 stakeholders in an account. Get to know them, bug them, find 
out their unique perspectives and motivationst
J Massive Action: Make 10X the dials you want. Follow up 10X as much. Every 
lever needs to be turned up to 11. Reps simply don’t take enough actiont
J 80/20 Rule: 10X Rule missed, Fanatical prospecting missed it. 80% of any system 
must be waste. 20% of your actions are driving 80% effectiveness. Apply Pareto 
as an overlay to everything. I could write an entire book just about thisj
J Calling on Signals: Set Outreach to “ruleset 3” so you get a task auto-dropped 
for any opens over 3. If someone views your LinkedIn, TRIPLE them (call, vmail, 
and email under 90 seconds). If they reply, triple them. If they open your email 
over 3x, triple them. Everything should be led with direct dials to cell phones. 
Don’t get stuck in Zoom gridlockt
J Use PADs: You need to be on a system that makes 4-10 dials per second aka a 
Parallel Assisted Dialer like ConnectAndSell. Manually dialing a phone in 2021 is 
a primitive move: dark ages. You need to invest in tech that lets you have 20 
conversations an hour vs. 5 per dayt
J Psychographic Data is The Next Frontier: Intent Data like Bombora and 6sense 
are all the rage now, crossing the chasm from early adopters, innovators to the 
latent majority. The new hotness is Psychographic data from companies like 
White Rabbit Intel. It doesn’t just figure out which account is clicking on keywords 
but which granular persona that you should target. It leverages AI and many 
ingestion points (APIs) across social to do this flawlessly

Self-actualized Prospects
No one can buy anything. Let me dig deeper into this. Our job as sales developers is 
to awaken the flame of desire in the prospect. As long as you’re persuading, cajoling, 
and convincing — you will fail. You are, in essence, pushing on a rope. What I learned 
from doing large, full-cycle deals is there is a magic moment when the polarity shifts 
and the customer is driving the sale. In the muddy bog of ambivalence, suddenly 
there’s traction in the back tires. I watched all manner of bizarre things happen with 
sales cycles as I sold in the same industry for 14 years, Mobile AdTech MarTech. I’d 
kick off a deal at one vendor point solution in NYC, and close it 3 years later in 
Seattle for another vendor. Why did this happen? They bought into “me,” my 
expertise. I established the trust, I eventually created desire and transcended the 
vendors themselves. I owned the relationship with the end customer. They 
repeatedly ran into the problem organically, boiled over, and reached out to me.

In Summary
Making effective cold calls is subtle. There is so much more than meets the eye. You 
need to be thinking about POWER, who is in charge. They will know you by the 
quality of your questions. If you are listening actively, you are in control. You need to 
be thinking in terms of push-pull interest/disinterest. Your goal is to create desire. 
How do you do this? You stimulate emotion. You poke the wound, twist a knife into it, 
and then bandage it. Hunting for new business is an art form. You need to aim high 
and be fearless. Neuroscience is easy - you know more about your brain and
that of the prospect than you’ve ever admitted to yourself.

Vampire Theory
The prospect has to ask you to pitch them. Legend has it that immortal vampires 
cannot cross the threshhold and come into your home before you invite them in. 
There’s a moment in the call or email where the prospect will ask you to pitch them. 
Your whole job is to keep the spotlight on the prospect until polarity shifts and they 
ask the vampire in to bite them.
Polarity Shifting
The entire space of cold call templates has focused on “The reason for my call” — 
jab-jab-hook. It’s solely focused on the caller and not the prospect. It causes friction. 
Your entire goal should be to keep the prospect talking. When applying RRM — 
during Routing and Ruin stages, you will feel the polarity shift. You are no longer 
pushing on a rope. The prospect is now pushing you to sell them. That’s when you 
know you will book a meeting. When you get a feel for where the focus for the 
conversation is and how to manipulate it, you will be in charge of every call.
Social Aikido
Have you ever seen a 75lb woman flip a 300lb fighter? Aikido and Jiu Jitsu masters 
use leverage. The bigger they are the harder they fall. Never before in the history of 
cold calling has someone called the prospect, validated the competitor, and 
acknowledged the journey with the competition. This translates so rapidly, a recent 
practitioner had a 51 minute call with the EVP of Sales after reading about RRM.

CODEX XIII
Cold Call Polarity Shifting


Codex XIII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
A Brief Note
I've made over 20,000 hours of cold calls.
And I’ve analyzed more calls than I can remember recently. The flaw I’ve noticed in 
nearly all the prevailing call scripts is that the perceived polarity never shifts.
As long as the focus remains on the sales rep and not the prospect, the rep is 
limiting their success.
99% of the systems start calls this way (Beta vs. Alpha): 
 “You don’t know me but... ” = Beta (focus on me — not you!
 “The reason for my call is...” = focus on the seller (beta)
The polarity needs to be prospect first! Listen first! 
I  have  found  that  executives  have  little  attention  for  long-form  content  or 
beating around the bush. Get the prospect talking about themselves and “what they  
control”  immediately  at  the  beginning  of  a  call.  Identify  their  immediate sphere 
of influence and get them to open up.
I discovered this trick back in 2007. I sold a piece of fundraising SaaS software that  
was  so  similar  to  others  on  the  market  that  everyone  I  called  would respond, 
“We already do that” or “we already have that in place.” I’d call 100 numbers and 
connect with seven out of ten executive directors and get shut down.
It was miserable, but I soon learned something that changed the entire dynamic for me.


Codex XIII
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
Power
"Who's in charge of _____?"
I noticed that prospects responded favorably when I mentioned their full name and 
remembered Dale Carnegie’s maxim, “The most beautiful sound in the English 
language is the sound of the prospect’s own name.”
So we started the call correctly because I always got a nice warm response 
pronouncing their full name right. But then every template I learned moved the 
spotlight right back to the seller:
“You don’t know me, but....
The reason for my call is...”
And a million variants.
I started to think about “decision-making” itself, spheres of influence, and what the 
prospect could control. Not their government, not their family, not the entire 
company... but what they could actually control was the little fiefdom of their P&L.
When you ask one specific type of question, you trigger the prospect to exercise 
their power. They puff out their chest like a proud peacock. This is like pointing a 
spotlight at the prospect and keeping it on them.
“Who’s in charge of your mobile strategy?” shifts the polarity to get the prospect 
talking. But this pattern interrupt could be any question that holds focus on the 
prospect.

Routing
Leverage within seconds
I have to admit calling a VP of Mobile and asking, “Who’s in charge of your mobile 
strategy?” was a bit like a Captain Obvious Jedi Mind Trick.
Wouldn’t it offend them? “Hey, bozo, go look at my LinkedIn profile – of course.” But 
99.9% of prospects said either “I am” somewhat proudly or made an immediate 
referral. Within seconds they forget I’m a solicitor and shunt me to the decision-
maker. I can get back on the horn and drop their name.
Suddenly I have leverage in the account vis-a-vis referral.
I talked with Ashleigh Early from “The Other Sales Coach,” and she said her go-to call 
opener is, “I’m calling in regards to your IT analytics...” She also was cluing into 
routing around the organization to find the person that handles the problem. Her 
second step includes a bit of enablement and education on the topic. I like both of 
these moves because you’re not going in pitching.
You’re getting them to talk!
Imagine calling a prospect, and instead of asking them “how they’re doing” or 
starting to pitch, you could instead shift the conversation to help them 
acknowledge their power. (ROUTE) I call this technique “route” because you are just 
trying to figure out “who’s who in the zoo.” Not everyone with the title of IT actually 
handles IT. There are 31 flavors of IT now from security, analytics, fraud, compliance, 
risk, systems, infrastructure... ad infinitum, especially if you sell into the Fortune 1000.

Vampires
Turning polarity into traction
Instead of cajoling, persuading, and convincing, you figure out how they are doing 
their current process even if they’re leveraging a competitive vendor. (RUIN) - Ask, 
“How’s that working out for you?” And just listen. Now when they tell you the 
competitor or build vs. buy story, VALIDATE the prospect. Tell them why they’re
right ––– No one does that!
I’m zooming way into one aspect of my Route-Ruin-Multiply (RRM™) call framework 
from one of my previous guides because I genuinely believe there is a magic 
moment on every cold call that can help you to be causal over the outcome. It’s a 
POLARITY shift.
Once you get them talking (ROUTE) and peel the onion on their existing process 
(RUIN) and you’ve asked, “How’s that working out for you?” Just lay in wait... 
Eventually, as you validate them and talk more and more about the current vendor 
and process, they do this really odd thing where the Polarity shifts, and they ask 
you, “Wait, what does your product do again?” Or, “Tell me more about AcmeCorp.”
The minute the polarity shifts, you suddenly have traction. I call this the Vampire 
Rule because legend has it; a vampire can only come in if invited over the threshold 
by their prey.
You’ve created desire, and now they have an interest. Pick up SPIN Selling by Neil 
Rackham and make sure you study the (i) Implications and (n) Need-Payoff. These are 
also called “next order value” questions.
Remember, what appears to be the problem is often just a system of deeper 
underlying issues.

Push vs Pull
Prospects begin to engage
I have seen the same dynamics shift in major deals. The seller is pushing on a rope. 
They are driving all the follow-up, relentlessly driving toward the next step – 
checking in, checking in. We have all been there! It’s exasperating. Unfortunately, this 
“high pressure” selling has become a proverb in SaaS.
There’s a far better way...Polarity! Until the polarity shifts, and the prospect starts
to drive the conversation reciprocally – drive for documents, drive to do final 
meetings – this is not a piece of business I even want to close.
If you are the only one pushing on a deal to close, imagine the stall when it hits 
fulfillment, and you are no longer driving it!
You drive the front half of the sale, but the prospect drives the back half – to 
effectively set a meeting with anyone from a cold call, to effectively close a business 
deal. Shifting the polarity is then a science almost as precise as electromagnetics, 
and the formula above can accomplish this seamlessly.
We are magnets in communication. Two plus signs repel. Communication must flow 
from the strong to weak force and shift back and forth, just like the electromagnetic 
current. Great communication has “great chemistry” – it’s electric.
“One cannot get blood from a stone, and one cannot keep pushing on a rope.”

Aikido
Selling the Way They Buy
We must learn to sell the way our prospects buy and follow a basic understanding of 
neuroscience to make emails and phone calls effective.  You need to start thinking 
of your calls like Social Aikido.
Have you ever watched a 100 lb. woman flip a 300 lb. man effortless with Aikido
techniques?
You use their force and weight to reposition and deploy their motion to your 
advantage — so many parallel metaphors to tactical selling. Use the force of motion 
of the prospects resistive “brush offs” to shift their weight like a tiny aikido master 
can flip a massive assailant. As they push the weight toward you, shift the energy 
right back with relevant questions and active listening.
Once you’ve finally peeled the onion on the pain and they’ve conceded to a path 
forward, let them reach out to you with desire. Once prospects drive the sale — the 
next steps, and the contract, it’s game over.
You’re going to do that deal!
There’s so much research on the “listen to a talk” ratio. I’ve seen it for and against 
the seller dominating the first interactions of calls and discovery calls, even in the 
Gong studies.

Trusting
Selling to Build Trust
This concept is really simple.
People love to talk about themselves. It’s about THEM.
Their problems, challenges, and opportunities. Even people that seem to be doing 
well are churning under the surface, seeking self-improvement.
We are bombarded with thousands of ads a day, which condition us to be 
dissatisfied. These techniques are somewhat of a safe crack. Without them, you’re 
just fighting through quicksand, pushing on a rope, and dragging an elephant.
Let’s move toward a paradigm of “Social Aikido,” even “Social Tai-Chi,” where we 
artfully encourage our dream prospects to open up about “what’s working”, which 
puts them into a safe position of trust where they can reveal their “gaps.”
Active listening, like therapy, puts our prospects in a headspace where they can at 
last “self examine.” We are the facilitators of self-actualized change.
They often don’t even know where to improve until a great seller (doctor, detective) 
helps guide them toward the light.

"If Everyone Else Is Zigging, Zag”
Look out across the messaging being pitched for cold calls and emails. Notice a 
pattern? A lot of it looks the same. Vanilla. Blase. Run of the mill. Par for the course. 
Try the same strategies in war over and over and you'll lose. Again and again. So 
how can you differentiate yourself and stand out?
Using a combination of first principles thinking and tried and true pattern interrupts 
honed over 20,000 hours of cold calls (and hundrends of thousands of emails), I've 
learned what cuts through the clutter - and separates the signal from the noise.
Welcome to unconventional communication.
If at any point you feel uncomfortable reading these approaches...
...they're working.
Principles
1st Principle Thinking
To stand out, you need to break down complicated problems into basic elements 
and then reassemble them from the ground up. This concept is called “first 
principles.”
Elon Musk inspires us all to think about this practice. He looks at a rocket and thinks 
along these lines: “The model is broken, so what if I deconstruct it into its simplest 
elements and start at the beginning?”. Then came cars and solar panels. So how do 
we break down sales?
Sales — in its simplest form — is akin to warfare.


Codex XII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
Like a castle under siege, we're trying to break through to the right person. If sales is 
war, then how do we view our prospecting through that lens? Looking at the most 
effective strategies, we see metaphors arising in the form of guerilla warfare and 
asymmetric warfare.
Classically, these methods of waging war are inherently disruptive.
Hit-and-run, attacking from different fronts, angles, and through varying methods 
have allowed conquerors throughout history to win.
How then, do we develop disruptive messaging and win that account?
Interrupt
Pattern Interrupts
The Purple Cow by marketing guru Seth Godin is a simple application of the neuro-
linguistic programming technique we call “‘pattern interrupt.”
Write something so bizarre that most are unlikely to forget.
This concept influences every word of my prospecting messages, concepts in 
branding, and sales approaches.
Stu Heinecke applies this approach to contact marketing in his magnum opus,
How To Get A Meeting With Anyone. He explains how he was getting a 100%
response rate and setting meetings with impossibly unavailable executives by
sending original cartoons via courier, inked by him on posterboards or etched
into wooden planks.
If everyone is zigging, zag.
If all the brands are blue, go red.


Codex XII

Application
Outbound Emails + Cold Calls
Studying the most common email templates in widespread circulation, it makes me 
uncomfortable to think about how similar they are.
Even just a simple thought experiment scaling the proposed 3-paragraph 
“personalize, value prop, social proof, personalize, CTA” format to the point where 
everyone leverages the concept makes you wonder why anyone thought it was a 
good idea.
Same with the popular phone scripts du jour.
My techniques prove effective because short-form messaging is processed in 3
seconds whereas 3 paragraph emails take 13 seconds. We process images 60,000 
times faster than text. As a kicker, it’s also out of the ordinary to open a Venn 
Diagram or explainer GIF (use getcloudapp.com) as a reply bump to the 3 sentence 
sales email that cuts straight to the point. Anything other than self-worshipping 
product marketing language would make you double take.
Shawn Sease used to put 4 blue dot emojis in his subject lines and eventually 
pointed out that Best Buy started using the technique. Did Best Buy catch the wave 
from Shawn?
As homosapiens, our complex language skills allow for a wide range of pattern 
interrupts, so here are some specific and fun examples I use because I’ve seen them 
convert empirically:


Codex XII
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
Examples
Time-Tested Tactics
£ Remove pleasantry — no need to say “hope you’re doing well,” or “in these 
uncertain times” - we need a 10 year moratorium on these phrasesl
i Lack of formality — “Hey Jane,” vs. “Hi” or “Dear Sir or Madame” — generally 
speaking, colloquial speech works betterl
T Drop expected formatting — No first name, no CTA, no formatting, no 
capitalization (Aaron Ross classic!), no salutation, no sign offl
J Grammar funk — Don’t even write in complete sentences, make it look choppy 
like business poetry — humanize and desterilize your languagel
G Just a picture with “thoughts?” — also a pattern interrupt because it’s a one-
word reply email (Venn Diagrams with competitors on the outside, you in the 
middle work great)l
 Hyperbole — “Would it be a crime against humanity if I asked you to spend 7 
minutes with me?” This is Voss negative labeling coupled with the fact you’re not 
asking for 7 instead of 15 minutes. I once asked for 13 minutes and the prospect 
responded, “I’ll give you 12!”l
P Humor — ”Before I start checking milk cartons, think we could hop on a zoom?” 
Take a risk to be funny, it converts. You can never make everyone happy but 
should also avoid self limiting beliefs. Talk to Jon Selig about how to write jokes 
in a B2B context, he had some classes going in 2020. Keep it classy San Diego{
 GIFs — Embedding a GIF into an email in a world where everyone else is 
hyperlinking. Spongebob converts; just ask Stephen Chase, the Sales Weasell
~ Facetime drop — can you imagine jumping in via this most personal and typically 
stranger-free medium:
£5 Hyper-personalization — this is the kind where you synthesize multiple insights 
combining both deep industry insight and references customized for the

individual. Things like quoting and timestamping something from a recent 
podcast they were on, a previous article they were mentioned in, and tying it 
together with relevancy. Avoid hacky and forced personalization like, “I noticed 
you went to BU, go Terriers! BTW you wanna buy something?”
Venns
A Picture is Worth 1,000 Words
Sending a Venn is something that marketing probably won't recommend. Which is 
exactly why you should send one: it's disruptive. I usually send them as the third part 
of my sequence. The core idea is to show your product as the all-in-one solution 
relative to a variety of companies offering single, disparate features. It shows that 
your company is the solution for your target's problems.
Here's how to make them:
Ã¿ Open Google Sheets > Insert > Drawin³
¯¿ In the Drawing sandbox, click the Shapes button and add 3 - 6 circles in a 
concentric pattern. You can adjust the circle transparency by clicking "Custom" on 
the color picker¿
«¿ Place a title next to each circle representing a feature that your solution offers. 
For example, Business Analytics. And then place the logos of companies offering 
just that feature in your space¿
¿ Use custom Google Image searches to find HD PNG company logos to place in 
those feature circles. Include the word "png" in your search and click "Tools" and 
then select "Large" to get a hi-res logo. You can also pull quick templates from 
Lucidchart and overlay the logos (no need to draw the circles).
I've included below some examples of Venns I've used in the past.

A Modern Science of Email Heuristics, Fractal 
Geometric Email Sequences & Holographic
Emotional Resonance 
Reps I train pay me $2,000 per hour to learn the most advanced applications of this 
system so they can become the best in the world at opening new business as I did. 
But I am giving my complete method away as a template in the spirit of Radiohead 
for all members of HYPCCCYCL.COM. All I ask, is you keep this confidential. If 
someone wants to read it, encourage them to enter our Mastermind. You are the 
stewards of the Method. Use it well; share it with those you trust who will take this 
seriously and foster better selling everywhere. Thank you. – Tony Stark

Intro
Several templates have become wildly popular for sales development. If you send 
them, you are doing the same thing as some large portion of the 600k+ SDRs and 
6.8MM AEs in the United States — a sea of monotony and mediocrity. To stand out 
you need to apply a Pattern Interrupt on the following: the form of the email, the 
linguistics or verbiage of the email, the tone of the email, the rhythm/frequency of the 
cadence. This method itself is a meta. If this method becomes famous enough, you 
cannot use it as is. If you copy-paste these templates they will only work for a little 
while. Once the masses catch on, the techniques will lose potency quickly. That is 
part of the magic — we’re exploiting a hole in the meta. The executives you want on 
the calendar know the standard sequence templates by heart — even if you 
rearrange the call and email steps, it is not enough. Radical change is required. This 
process will need to continue to evolve, and for that we need each practitioner to 
learn the concepts and execute with their own unique flair. This will protect the 
system from becoming rote and ignorable. This is not one-size-fits-all and not for the 
faint of heart. Learn the techniques based on how we are thinking about cold 
outreach, not exactly what we have printed here.
If you copy and paste the Justin Michael Method™ (JMM) emails verbatim, they will 
outperform anything you have ever sent immediately because they are hyper-short. 
They are so painfully short, Marketing may stop you from sending them. People will 
question your judgement and apply the prevailing wisdom available to them, the 
same prevailing wisdom we are intentionally avoiding. Send them anyway; ask for 
forgiveness not permission. Open rates will go up to 80% and reply rates closer to 
10% when you get this technique right. If you are not getting the open rates and
reply rates as advertised, bring it up to the group. We will come together, identify 
areas for improvement in your approach, and get you to the promised land. 
Obviously, if you have an impacted domain where DKIM, DMARC of SPIF are 
compromised, fix that first.

On Targeting
If you don’t have good data, point the system at less than optimal targets, or skip 
over crucial personas — it will not work properly. Make sure you multi-thread all 
accounts contacting multiple executives at the same time in each sequence. Running 
one executive at a time in a 30 day standard sales outreach sequence is a snail’s 
pace. We are giving you the schematics to build a hyperdrive — approach lightspeed 
by finding 3-5 contacts in each account who own results impacted by the pain you 
solve and target them all simultaneously. Running a 2 week sequence with saturated 
touch points you will get answers faster. If you get unsubscribed or torpedoed on the 
phone, go a level up immediately. Call their boss with the same lack of deference. 
This starts a polyrhythm where the first few targets are in one cadence and the 
second layer starts at a different time, creating an odd time signature of cascading 
emails and phone calls. In music this is interesting to our ears. This will make an 
impression on your targeted buyers. Soon enough people at the target company will 
be talking about you in a slack channel or in morning scrums. Imagine! A Fortune 50 
VP talking to their peers about you, the lowly SDR with a style that won’t quit.
You can also “flank” or contact unusual titles like HR or engineering to get referred 
in. It should feel scary. Run the detractor’s superior through a sequence. Land triples 
everywhere. If it doesn’t work and you get no response (unlikely), make lateral 
moves — look for one of their connections who can introduce you in the sidebar on 
Sales Navigator
You must never give up until you understand from a business standpoint why the 
deal is not progressing this quarter. Getting hung up on is not a good reason why. 
Getting unsubscribed is not a good reason why. Worrying about these inevitabilities 
implies a lack of confidence in your business case and it might be time to go back to 
the drawing board. There exists no business executive on the planet who would turn 
down an opportunity to generate more revenue, mitigate risk, or reduce operational

expenditure because they were upset you called them too many times, provided that 
opportunity is genuine. Learn about the real business objectives that take priority 
and compete with your calendar spot. Report this crucial information back to your 
own CEO/CRO or management. This is the worst possible outcome you should 
accept.
Warning: you must build a meaningful business case before you begin to apply the 
type of pressure outlined below. This is the foundation for your success — your 
relentlessness regarding growth at your prospect’s company will be appreciated. 
After all — your company is still in business for a reason and selling to others in the 
same industry. Applying these strategies without at least a cursory knowledge of 
their industry, what the prospect stands to gain, and trouble they seek to avoid puts 
us in danger of burning accounts and contacts to oblivion.
JMM™ Checkpoints
Before sending anything ask yourself:
¡ Is it painfully shortª
¡ Is it assertive? (deference to leadership at your prospect’s 
org puts you in a weaker position¬
¡ Is there pain/fear highlighted in every touch? (prospects 
buy on emotion, close on logic¬
¡ Can any individual touch in the sequence represent the 
whole thing? (see fractal geometric shape approach ¬
¡ Did you spend no more than 30s – 1min personalizing?
Heuristics
The most powerful geometric frame we could apply to writing email sequences is 
fractal or holographic — the wholeness is present everywhere and within every


The Justin Michael Method™

entity. A fractal repeats an integral pattern infinitely. Russian Nesting Dolls similarly 
contain a version of their entire shape within the shape itself. If you are familiar with 
MC Escher you are familiar with fractals. Zooming in on a coastline, snowflake, or 
romanesco broccoli, the outer pattern infinitely repeats within the internal structure 
of the figure.
We wouldn’t take up your valuable learning and development time explaining a 
wildly abstract mathematical concept if it was not fundamental to understanding the 
underlying theme used to develop this email and cadence strategy. Our entire 
universe exhibits these same repeating patterns, why not our emails? At every level 
of scale, the pattern outlining the whole emerges.


The Justin Michael Method™
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
In the seemingly unrelated yet mysteriously connected context of an email 
sequence, each touch point should represent the initial concept in finer layers of 
never ending detail. Later in Advanced Strategies we will explore repeating concepts 
across personas with a snowflake-like pattern of outreach, iterating concepts as we 
zero in on the bag holders.
An email has a meta concept, signal, tone or ideal. There’s a meta or “above” 
framework on every line break. The sentence, “did a crocodile eat you?” can be 
represented as <humor lever>.


The Justin Michael Method™
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
So a template in a heuristic meta frame reads like this:
Hey {{Name}},

<Humor lever> icebreaker
<Social Proof> (similar clients)
<CTA> — call to action

Thanks, ← <gratitude>
{{sender.name}}
The sheer genius and beauty of this is that you can take any popular template or 
piece of a template that you are leveraging right now and break it into heuristic 
meta frames.
You can spear it, you can bump it. Let me show you... (skip below to template 
examples)
Specificity
The vast majority of email templates are far too generic and vague. Specific content 
is exact. 300% growth is not believable. 326% is. Driving 34 meetings on 515 chats is 
specific. We drive 1.62M in revenue I’d believe vs. 1MM which raises my BS alarm. 
Round numbers are not your friends. This is similar to Todd Caponi’s transparency 
sale where customers have more trust in 4.2 stars than 5 stars. (Note: he was actually 
my sales trainer at Salesforce!)


The Justin Michael Method™
discord.gg/hypcccycl

JM Spears™
Compacted emails as short as possible that only focus on the prospect’s pain (fear), a 
solution, and relevance. The overall strategy is to pattern interrupt against the “long 
as a novel” emails with 3 paragraphs that are getting promoted now. Keep the three 
paragraphs from those systems and “SPEAR” them like you took a trash compactor.
You can take any template that’s popular right now from a website, from your 3rd 
party SDR-as-a-service company, from your top rep, and crunch it down into a 1-3 
word title, and 3 sentences with a CTA. Ideally, you will send a spear and two 
bumps. Bumps are just replies that happen, ideally at random times in the next two days.
More pain = more conversion.
Why it should look UGLY
I was in mobile marketing for 13 years. There are hundreds of screen variations on 
the various handset models when you move into Droid land between old, 
refurbished, new and various countries. Spears should be ugly. No spacing. Let me 
give you an example of a COMPACTED SPEAR:
Hey Ray, Your quote about keyless entry and geolocation in wired was spot on. 
Our tech enables that but gives much more accurate fences, so you could 
trigger the app loyalty program from the parking lot and deep link each user 
into the exact door unlock function seamlessly. Would that warrant a quick 
zoom? Thanks, Justin
Hey Jim - Noticed your time at Acme, they’re a current customer using us for 
(thing you do) — was hoping to go over some similar ideas with you. If it makes 
sense, when is good to jump on a call? Thanks -JM

you’re open to discuss bolstering your risk mitigation strategy re: new 
customers? (prospect’s competitor) is happy! Thanks-Justin

Notice the grammar mistakes and variations. These emails resemble tweets you 
might have pounded out sitting in the drive thru at McDonalds. I’m not making this
up — these last three were anonymised and pulled directly from one trainee’s sent 
folder after they booked multiple VPs at each of three Fortune 100 companies in a 
one month period. One of the big 4 tech giants wants to talk with their company 
soon too — news came in after a Triple.
Triples
Call, voicemail, email as fast as you can with limited personalization. It works 
because of the saturation or frequency of touches creating a bee swarm effect. Read 
comboprospecting.com where I was the case study.


The Justin Michael Method™
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
But Justin — Where is the Personalization?
Per Jeremey Donovan, testing 6MM emails at SalesLoft, only ~20% personalization is 
needed. Aaron Ross confirms that any more is just creepy. It shows hunger, even 
desperation, to go too deep on personalization and this also flies in the teeth of the 
prevailing methods. David Sandler always cautioned, “Don’t spill your candy in the 
lobby.” Pique interest but hold something back!
Beyond the inherent neediness implied with mention of a prospect’s alma mater, 
insistence on personalizing to this level is a symptom of a limiting heuristic, ultimately 
a time sink fatal to your productivity. If you can’t find a first degree connection who 
knows the prospect, a current customer where the prospect used to work, or similar - 
switch to industry and persona based levels of personalization. These are more 
generalized therefore increase velocity. Fractal heuristics emerge once more as a 
bump in your activity velocity increases pipeline velocity, increasing overall sales 
velocity.
We reach a point of diminishing returns on personalization going much past 
something immediately relevant and take up valuable real estate. You’ve got 
between 40-100 characters between the subject line and first part of your email that 
will show up in the preview text on a mobile device notification or email client. If we 
spend them mentioning a 2nd down play from a Huskies vs. Cougs game the 
prospect attended in high school, the slathering admiration is a turnoff to a busy 
executive. They are used to swiping 200 emails a day that read like this. Instead, get 
straight to the point.
Phone Script

to ask someone in charge of Mobile Strategy, “Who’s in charge of mobile strategy?”
Opener: Hey John, Justin Michael from Acme Corp. Who’s in charge of your 
[domain] strategy?
Route
OK, can I tell them you referred me?
Ruin
Objection: We already use another supplier or do that internally.
That’s fine, how’s that working out for ya? (pause) [This single question has 
made me millions of dollars!]
Multiply
Why not plug us in as a turbo-charger alongside your current solution to 
multiply its effectiveness? (pause)
Relentlessly seek the right person to speak with. If you get the referral, ask the 
prospect to introduce you. If you get the referral on LinkedIn or in reply to an email - 
screenshot the linkedin message — and send it in an email. Prove that you got 
referred. Call the person you’ve been referred to and reference that you just talked 
to their boss, for example.
The best way to get someone to admit the fault of the incumbent supplier is an 
innocuous nonchalant question like, “You use Beta Corp, oh that’s interesting, how’s 
that working out for you?” This question is akin to, “Are you happy?” or “Would you 
like to make more money?” They will invariably spill the beans and admit to low 
customer service levels, missed deadlines, political issues. They’ll give you the FUD 
you need to lever in — land and expand from a beachhead position.

Voicemail Script
The key here is it’s under 30 seconds and laden with 20% personalization and major 
social proof.
Hey Sarah, Justin Michael from Acme Corp 917.232.2164 (slower) – I’m calling 
because I was reading your profile and noticed you’re innovating the ERP 
strategy there. I wanted to tell you about a product that could have high 
relevance to your {domain – ex. ”mobile” } strategy. We have helped company 
X, Y, and Z drive a  _ quantified outcome like _ 30% revenue increase in under 3 
months by optimizing their ERP delivery with automation and RPA. Again, Justin 
Michael from Acme Corp 917.232.2164 (slower), I’ll follow up with a quick note.
Email Templates
It’s so critical that you reference the voicemail you just left. The purpose of the 
voicemail is to indicate to the prospect that you will send the email. The purpose of 
the follow-up email is to indicate that you just left the voicemail. This creates a 
circuitous feedback loop where they go check the message to delete. This bee 
swarms their device and it lights up 7 times.
Hey Sarah, Per my voicemail, we helped X, Y, Z company drive a [quantified] 
32% revenue increase via [utility statement like] advanced mobile analytics 
driven by AI and ML that learns as it works. If it makes sense to talk, how does 
your calendar look? Thanks, Justin | Strategic Accounts

*Note: the lack of the word “sales” in the title of the email sender.

Reply Bump Strategy
Bumps are just responses to an initial thread that “bump up” in Gmail or in Outlook. 
Rather than make every touch in a sequence an individual thread, do a thread and 
bump up a couple of times the next couple days. One JMM pro reported every 
meeting booked in a 6 month period using this system came from a positive 
response to 1 word reply bump: “Thoughts?” Here is where your creativity will shine 
with images, humor, radical changes in style, gifs, caricatures drawn via Fiverr.com, or 
anything else you can create.
Nudges
No one has ever documented this idea in any book including my own. If you have a 
sequencer that is actively generating views and a specific sequence generates over 
3 views, you do a nudge. It’s literally like a Facebook poke: a manual reply from 
within Salesloft, Outreach, Groove, or XANT just saying, “Thoughts?” and then you 
leave the sequence running.
Overlaying Combo Over an Existing Sequence
Like Agoge
I can attest I had a pod of 5 running Agoge on zeros and they added Triples over the 
top. It went on to set 65 meetings in 30 days nearly immediately. This is not to say 
Agoge doesn’t work but you need to custom fit the phone touches.
Take any existing sequence and add TRIPLEs every 24 hours. Call on Signals which 
means:

H If you get a profile view — triple (call, vmail, email under 90 seconds<
H If you get over 3 opens — triple (set a ruleset to 3 in Outreach/SalesLoft 
custom settings<
H If someone interacts with your social posts — triple
Complete Sequence Clusters & Narratives
I have never seen another author, trainer, or sales leader look at sequences as 
geometric shapes. In this case, we have 12 touches happening over two weeks with 
3 clusters of 3 pings each. This is 3 email threads with 2 bumps each. This type of 
geometric thinking with Spears, Bumps, and then Nudges (if you get high opens) 
interlaced is again a heuristic or meta-framework.

Advanced Tactics
Visuals connote 60,000 words of emails. Instead of waiting until cluster 3 to unleash 
the Venn diagram, why not send it as the 2nd reply bump to your first email. 
(Example Venns | JMM Venn Training Webinar Recording)
This will likely gain attention from the 3-5 C-level/VP/Directors you’ve sent it to - they 
will talk to each other. Pay attention to the opens with pixel tracking software like 
Outreach or Yesware. You will notice that people keep going back to the Venn 
because it is interesting and unique, they have never seen anything like it before. 
When the Venn is getting attention, you can break away from the sequence outlined 
in the base-level guide above. Now, instead of waiting for 2 days for the sake of the 
sequence, continue to bump the Venn thread to the prospect who is opening it.
Now you have an opportunity to get creative. You can decide to omit the 48-hour 
waiting period between clusters and change the format of the spear entirely. At this 
point you have someone on the hook. If an executive opened your email and didn’t 


The Justin Michael Method™

delete it, then went back to it the next day or later on in the afternoon - this is a major 
signal that you’ve hit on something that can help them. There is no other reason an 
executive at any company from mid-market all the way through Top 5 companies 
worldwide would spend any extra time looking at a Venn diagram that wasn’t going 
to make them money
One concept leveraged recently was using this opportunity to employ assertiveness 
in the approach. Say you’re running JM-spears, bumps, and Venn diagrams on 5 
executives and notice they are paying attention to it. Keep bumping the email thread 
with the Venn, no more than 5 days in a row — then pivot and send a 1 line email to 
the same executive: “Hey name, who’s in charge of your overall (blank) strategy? 
Thanks, Justin.” This exact strategy was used at a Fortune 50 company recently by 
an early adopter of the Justin Michael Method™ (JMM). The executives talked to each 
other and collectively raised the white flag, sending a senior director inbound to the 
salespersons company to book a call. The senior director mentioned our early 
adopter. Notice a reply was never obtained - the JMM system flashed so much 
insight in so few words at a frequency never before seen by the team, they were 
influenced to take a look at the software.

LinkedIn Outreach Examples
Hey Edgar, We help companies like Beta Corp, drive 67% revenue growth 
through improved deterministic seed for their DSP. We work with AngelFire, 
DogSitter, and Blimpy2 in this pursuit. When’s a good time to show you the why 
and the how? Thanks, Justin
Hey Sarah – Based on your retargeting skill listed on profile, we have the 
ultimate turbo-chargerfor pure native mobile – deterministic seed data. It’s in 
production on Acme, Beta, and Zeta lifting campaigns by 67%. When’s a good 
time to talk shop about how this could work for you at Beta Corp?
What to Personalize
An exact quantified result you have driven for a similar customer, if you can’t mention 
that customer’s name say, “We helped the largest travel company increase margin by 
3% through [curve jumping use case]”
Pull a quote from a recommendation. “Mark, I saw that rec Amanda made saying you 
are the savviest AdTech person she’s ever worked with. I think you’re the ideal 
person to run our solution by because you’ll get how deterministic seed data helped 
AngelFire 5X it’s accuracy which results in a 3.6MM increase in ARR.”

Synthesis = Insight
When I built systems to send 100 concurrent Outreach campaigns and sent millions 
of emails I had the ability to personalize on Demographic (people), Firmographic 
(companies, Psychographic (feelings/interests), and Technographic (what data is in 
their stack) factors. What I learned is if you mash together any of these into blended 
insight, you get something that immediately looks consultative. This may be the 
highest value HACK in the entire method. I only recently realized how to even 
articulate what I was doing. Again, you guessed. It’s a heuristic.
Examples of Synthesis:
Hey Cynthia – Based on how you’ve increased (1) your headcount by 43% or 
37 heads, and your (2) recent M&A of CareStock, Inc., it’s apparent that you 
may have data discrepancies that our crowdsourced workforce of 40,000+ can 
handle in a matter of weeks where your internal process could take months. I 
noticed you’re hiring for (3) 3 data engineers and your head of IT just left and 
(4) John Ringle came in as the new CIO. All this creates a perfect storm around 
the need to rapidly figure out your data normalization strategy. When’s a good 
time to talk? Thanks, Justin
Just pull 3 or 4 elements of personalization, crunch them into compacted “spear” 
level length and make an assumptive tying all this personalization to the relevance of 
what your solution (product or service) solves. Even if you get it wrong, you have 
immediate trusted advisor status.

works? You gain 18 characters of real estate between the subject line and 
preview textf
,f No CTA — Lop off the call to action completelyf
Mf Grammar funk the text. “When’s a good time to talk?” “Lemmeno!” “Why dont I 
show you why+how+ROI.” Why it works? Broken grammar is a differentiated 
heuristic — signals humanity and confidencef
Wf Self-deprecation — reverse psychology. “Hey Jethro — I hate writing automated 
emails as much as you hate getting them. Would you like to burn this with me 
after reading?”
Stunts at Your Own Risk
Students of the Justin Michael Method™ have gone as far as “live” FaceTime Drops, a 
massive pattern interrupt. They have even sent Spongebob cartoons as visual 
prospecting. I’ve seen all manner of radical, hyper-short, emotionally resonant, wild, 
funny, chopped, compacted SPEAR emails go out in all manners of frequency and 
combination. Go wild from this baseline. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. This 
stuff is Picasso. Reply rates move 3-5X.
Outro
“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
— Arthur C. Clarke, Futurist
I referred to a student of JMM as an “early adopter” in Advanced Strategies because 
the JMM is essentially a new piece of sales technology for reps in 2020.

The method, however, is nothing new. This is not a guess or a hunch. It’s not even 
based on any intelligence gained from an AB test of different styles or KPI rundowns.
Where did it come from then? I have personally played a main part in the 
development and refinement of the JMM. I have used these strategies to earn 
millions of dollars in enterprise SaaS over the last 20 years. JMM practitioners are 
advancing their careers within 4-6 months of implementing. Nobody else on your 
sales floor knows about this because I haven’t made the content available for the 
general public until now. Execution effectiveness will decline with copy/paste 
strategies. It is ok to stay close to the suggestions for now, but I want to implore you 
to get creative on your own and tell us what works. The JMM is a malleable 
framework. It will always evolve and grow towards the hole in the meta.
Popular email formats and attempts at scaling deep personalization with a systematic 
approach do not produce results as quickly or with as much consistency. I know this 
because I’ve tried. I redlined these systems for months, going as fast as humanly 
possible and prospecting with more personalization premises than you can imagine. 
Part of the problem was that I could not do the work fast enough - spending an hour 
or more per day on personalizing your emails results in less emails and less phone 
calls. If instead you spent that hour sending semi to heavy (when quickly available) 
personalization in JM-Spears and leaving voicemails in triple format, my experience 
and observation of others implementing the JMM suggests you would get more 
meetings in a shorter time frame. I received an award for generating 6 years worth of 
pipeline in 6 months using this exact strategy. Your CEO and VP of sales will be 
tagging you for a quick Zoom to tell you “nice job.” It’s a true story.
Give it a shot. Try even just a few strategies from this document and let me know if 
you’re still having trouble setting meetings. My promise: when you master the 
techniques, applying the 80/20 principle will allow you to reach beyond-human 
levels of productivity. In turn, you’ll increase earning potential and take control of 
your own destiny.

Quick Summary
Purpose
X Trimmed down version of the JMMQ
X Actionable quick hitH
X See main document for a deep dive
JMM™ Checkpoints
Before sending anything ask yourself:
X Is it painfully short
X Is it assertive? (deference to leadership at your prospect’s org 
puts you in a weaker position
X Is there pain/fear highlighted in every touch? (prospects buy 
on emotion, close on logic
X Can any individual touch in the sequence represent the whole 
thing? (see fractal geometric shape approach
X Did you personalize quickly? Try not to spend as much time 
here, more time reaching contacts across your accounts
JM-Spears™
Compacted emails as short as possible that only focus on the prospect’s pain (fear), a 
solution, and relevance. The overall strategy is to pattern interrupt against the typical 
emails with 3+ paragraphs that are getting promoted now. Take the three 
paragraphs from those systems and “SPEAR” — shorten to 1 sentence each. Or, 
write 3 new sentences of your own. Comments in italics.
Subject line: [relevant info bit] + [key word]
Greeting: Hey [name] —


The Justin Michael Method™
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
Sentence 1: [mention relevant info bit], curious if you’re open to discuss
[specific outcome related to key word] strategy?
Sentence 2: [lookalike customer] uses us to [achievable outcome] by [x% or $x].
CTA: If it makes sense, when can we hop on a zoom?
Relevant info: recent news article esp. with quote, notable industry event or trend, 
previous workplace in common with a customer — any strong personalization bit — 
don’t spend too much time here. Have a slightly generic industry or persona bit 
ready to go if you can’t find anything.
Key words: growth, risk, revenue.
Notice the “tapout” in the CTA — this is a very assumptive email, but is a very soft 
ask — it allows the prospect to make a decision on their own.
Email Heuristics
Instead of following a template, think about the emails in a more general format. This 
way you can construct multiple spears on your own and A/B test them.
Here is a quick example:
Hey {{Name}},
<Humor lever> icebreaker
<Social Proof> (similar clients)
<CTA> - call to action
Thanks, ← <gratitude>

Spears should be ugly. No spacing. Let me give you examples of a COMPACTED JM-
SPEAR:
Hey Ray, Your quote about keyless entry and geolocation in wired was spot on. 
Our tech enables that but gives much more accurate fences, so you could 
trigger the app loyalty program from the parking lot and deep link each user 
into the exact door unlock function seamlessly. Would that warrant a quick 
zoom? Thanks, Justin
Hey Jim - Noticed your time at Acme, they’re a current customer using us for 
(thing you do) - wanted to go over some similar ideas with you. If it makes 
sense, when is good to jump on a call? Thanks -JM
Hey John, Q4 is almost here with so much growth happening - curious if you’re 
open to discuss your lead gen strategy re: data? (prospect’s competitor) is 
happy! Thanks-Justin
Hey Glen - John Doe set us up on LI - Acme saved $75MM in OpEx by calling 
our API for <<thing you do>> in various workflows - if this makes sense still, how 
does your calendar look? Thanks

Relevance at Scale


Codex V
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
Scaling relevance is a simple concept because it does not require input every time 
you need to reach out to someone and this saves minutes per lead, which ends up 
as hours per day and week — the payoff is nearly endless if you can make your 
research lightning fast. Instead of relying on the customized bit to get them to meet 
with you, rely on your knowledge of their workflow, their industry, and their 
company’s specific goals.
After these relevance pulls, there is no reason to continue to make the message 
specific to one person. Customizing an email does not garner an response. Personal 
information available online is not a good enough reason to give a stranger any time 
out of their busy day. Think of the salary for a VP at an enterprise company. How 
much money is 15 minutes worth? Identifying a week spot in their workflow and 
proposing a solution is more likely to set a meeting. What if you were to spend your 
time understanding the hangups and areas where extra time is spent that your 
software might be able to help? How is the company trying to make money? Can you 
improve that for them? Read the 10k document. Find out what the company 
In order to create relevance there are three specific things you can check in order to 
customize to the person. These will actually push you over the edge:
¡ Does the prospect know anyone you know? This is gold in terms of 
customization
¡ Has the prospect worked at a company that you have as a customer? You should 
mention it: “Hey John, noticed your time at Acme — they’re a customer of ours...” 
and scope the use case for Acme with very succinct and unique phraseology
¡ Is the person active on social media or have been quoted in an article, podcast, 
or other media? If it is relevant, you should pull it and use in the first line of your 
email. Remember, 3 sentences total — 4 is a last resort if you need it.

initiatives are. Start low in the org and talk to sales reps (shoutout Kevin Dorsey) — 
find out where they have issues and propose a solution. These relevant points are 
going to cause the high level target to perk up and answer you when coupled with 
an aggressive reply bump strategy maximizing you propensity to get opens.

Let's get right into it. Here's a collection of templates I've written for clients across a 
variety of industries. One subscriber reported setting a meeting with a luxury hotel 
branded by a former president by plugging in one of these exactly on first send.
You'll notice some similarities:
~} No personalizationy
f} 3-4 sentence MAXy
W} Funked grammam
T} All one line — no formatting, no breaks (this is for a reason 
I'll explain later so just do itj
O} Typos, especially THanks (this is how execs communicate 
with each other — they type fast and don’t backspace)
And away we go.
Template 1
Hey (name) - Curious if your team is spending time working on customizing 
apps and automation across departments? BigTechCorp is saving $1.6M/year in 
opex by reducing spend on IT and licensing with our inclusive platform solution. 
Would you be open to a short zoom? Lemmeno
Template 2
Hey {{first_name}} - Curious if you’re open to innovation re: CX? Acme is able to
automate 89% of their CS inquiries, saving 19k rep hours -- launched in 30 
days, no IT bandwidth necessary. If it makes sense Q3/Q4, should we set up a 
call? THanks -- {{sender.first_name}}

Template 3
Hey (name) - Are there any converged infrastructure initiatives at (company) 
this year? We provide Acme a single entry point for orchestrating systems with 
an easy GUI and handle delegation of control with clearly defined delegation 
points between silos. They use us to automate certificate management and
procurement. Would this warrant investigation?
Template 4
Hey (name) - Are merchants happy with your current payment stack? Setting up 
and managing multiple gateways can be a headache - our tool connects any 
payment gateway, partner merchant, or service in 100+ countries and 
currencies, gives you instant access to transacting in new markets. Open to
throwing some time on our calendars in the next few weeks?
Template 5
Hey (name), Q1 underway, so much growth - curious if you’re open to chat 
payment API strategy? Acme and beta use our platform because it gives 
flexibility globally and routes transactions to automatically get the best ROI - 
we’re not a gateway or processor. If it makes sense for 2022, talk soon?

Template 6
Hey (name) - per my voicemail, I have a product relevant to your work with the 
sales team -- we helped ACme save 10+ hours a week and increase revenue by 
50% -- “I would tediously create Word docs and then manually transfer 
customer data from [our crm] into the document.” said Acme CEO. If you're
spending rep hours like this, should we set up a call?
Template 7
Hey (name) - Any time to chat re: innovation around customer experience w/ 
support + impact on your brand? Acme was able to reduce a backlog by 93% in 
one month by moving away from ticket based systems. [We] helped streamline 
both customer xp and internal workflow -- without adding headcount, they were 
able to handle a 25% seasonal spike. Any initiatives to allocate budget towards 
CX for 2021? Thanks - (initials)
Template 8
Hey (name) - curious if you’re open to chat re: certificate management 
strategy? PKI infractions via expired certificates can lead to downtime or
even data breaches -- Acme reduced certificate deployment time by 90%
using granular, role based permissions to build and deploy certificates in <1
hour. If it makes sense to think about for 2022, would you be open to a call?

Template 9
Hey (name) - wanted to talk with the person in charge of your security team. We 
integrate into all major CAs -- allow discovery of SSL certificates across 
network devices and communicate with the respective CA’s to create or renew 
certificates. FincorpUSA and TelecomGiant have used us to automate the 
process and focus more on revenue generating activities. Any time Q1 for a 
zoom? Thanks
Template 10
Hey (name) - curious if you’re open to chat re: wireless EEG? Main 
differentiators are EEG recordings are accessible anywhere/anytime, real time 
HIPAA compliant data transmission, and reduced prep with enhanced patient 
experience via a wireless headset. If it makes sense Q3, can we find a quick 
zoom?
Shorter emails are significantly more effective in booking a meeting. Your results will 
improve with a simple 24-hour reply email in-thread: "Thoughts?"
Empirically, Shorter emails with a thoughts bump are 15x more likely to book a 
meeting.

Disclaimer
Dear reader, please implement responsibly. Reps using these techniques have 
achieved promotions, paid off houses, bought car & waltzed their way into the 
President’s Club. Proceed with caution.
Intro
My name is Justin Michael, and I'd like to personally thank you for reading this.
I've spent 20 years in the trenches as an SDR. Learning the ins and the outs. Paying 
with blood (ask me about NY), sweat, and tears. And what I've learned over the years 
is this: cold calling isn't dead. Not by a long shot. In fact, if done right, it can be one 
of your greatest tools for filling your pipeline. Sure, there might be industries where it 
converts better than others. But you didn't get in sales to hang up the towel, did 
you? Try this and watch your pipeline truly grow. What you're about to read has been 
honed over two decades. Word for word. Sentence by sentence. So if you're 
satisfied with your current results, delete this. Throw it away. Please. But if you'd like 
to get a taste of finally cracking TOF on the phone... This is it. Introducing the RRM 
and RRR methods.
Welcome to 3021.


Codex VII
discord.gg/hypcccycl

salesborgs.ai
Step 1: Intro
Say the prospect's full name — go for the pronunciation even if it’s hard:
Is this Nancy Kowalczik? Koh - wal - chik.
Yes
Hey It’s Justin Michael from Acme Corp.
Step 2: Route
Just curious.... Who’s in charge of your 
CX strategy?
Why what’s this about?
I have some CX tech but don’t want to 
waste your time... just curious who heads 
up CX, does that roll up to you?
RRM
Route. Ruin. Multiply.
The first 3 heartbeats determine everything:
ñ Whether you get hung up onë
ñ Whether you get routed or notë
ñ Get told to pound sand, or..ë
ñ Get to the next step in your script.


Codex VII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
Step 3: Ruin (Peel the Onion)
How do you do that now, do you handle 
it internally or work with a 3rd party? 
OPTION 1:
Oh, we actually build internally...
Oh, did you choose to do that or 
someone there before you? 
How long did it take you to build it out? 
OPTION 2:
We already have a vendor
Makes sense — who do you use?
or
Won’t disclose:
Can’t say
Oh, interesting... what do you like about 
them? [Then shut up...] 


Codex VII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
If they name the vendor:
They do nothing:
Other:
What not to do:
Doing nothing is a choice, validate it. Always validate the status quo; agree, make 
them right. If they surface pain, peel the onion with open questions - preferably SPIN 
(situation problem need pay-off). NEVER address a pain by spoon feeding your 
solution, feature function, or benefits. Once they start talking about why their 
decision or indecision is right they invariably move across the emotional spectrum 
from positive to negative, surfacing pain. It seems unlikely this would happen but it’s 
the greatest reverse psychology breakthrough I discovered on thousands of calls. 
When you get a PAIN — peel the pain. Never meet a pain with a bandage, never 
bandage the wound. Instead, twist the knife. Be Columbo vs. Marry Poppins “spoon 
full of sugar.”
It’s Beta Corp
Beta Corp is great, how’s that working 
out for you? [pregnant pause.... Wait]
Our customer service is great.
[Focus on YOUR solution]
We don’t do it at all
We love Beta corp mostly but the 
Customer Service is pretty weak.


Codex VII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
What to do:
Oh, that’s interesting, why is customer 
service interesting/important to you?
Well, as a matter of fact, our CS team is 
based in Australia so we need to wait 
one day to get a ticket answered. Not an
issue except at the end of the month 
when we charge credit cards, customers 
can’t refund for 72 hours & go ballistic
Oh no! What happens then?
It’s costing us millions in negative Google 
and G2 Crowd reviews knocking spilling 
blood on Page One.
Oh, your customer service is an issue. 
What would happen if you fix it?
Honestly, I calculated, we would reduce 
churn by 15% percent which adds 3 
million in ARR.


Codex VII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
Step 4: Multiply
Look, Nancy – don’t change what you’re 
currently doing (frictionless) — plug us in 
alongside Acme Corp to multiply the 
effectiveness of your current solution.
Other good verbs for MultiplyX
Y Turbochargee
Y Force multipliere
Y Spikee
Y Boost 
You want to position Augmentation over rip and replace — they’re on a heavy 
multi-year SaaS contract so you’d be DOA. 
RRR
Route. Ruin. RIP.
This means you run the Route Ruin to pitch later in the framework and when you 
pitch, do a solid full value prop to differentiate why you’re better. The time delay on 
when you pitch will make it much more potent to convert.
Personalization — 3x3 research works well — 3 facets of personalization in 3 
minutes. I call this Synthesis or Hyper-Personalization — recently I’m dubbing it


Codex VII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
Personalization stacking
Scan their LinkedIn profile, Twitter, and a quick Google search and tie any 3 points 
together. Right brain left brain is best — something logical something emotional.
Noticed you went to Notre Dame, 
majored in Applied Statistics, and won 
30 under 30.  
Better would be — tying their Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award 
back to a facet of their agile software development team approach.
Hey Nancy, Noticed you got the 30-
under-30 as an entrepreneur, it reminds 
me a lot of our founder who had a similar
award and cracked into the IT world 
young like you. 
Be relatable, tying personalization to relevance. Use the stacking
to mention multiple points in the email or call.
A note on tone
DMV Approach + Air Traffic Control
Neutralize your voice “no hunger” like it’s the DMV counter or you’re directing air 
traffic at the airport. The less emotion and more downtones the more control. 
When you’re getting hang-ups in the first three heartbeats you’re not downtoning 
and sounding like you work at the DMV = non-salesy is the key.


Codex VII
discord.gg/hypcccycl
|
salesborgs.ai
When RRM fails... You’re not following the nuances above or the word “charge” is 
too combative. Ask the top script differently when you hit the R over and over...
What’s this about?
Instead of “Who’s in charge of your IT strategy?” 2nd time ask:
 Who heads up your IT strategyu
 Who’s responsible for your IT strategyu
 Who’s the appropriate person on IT 
strategy? (speak with finesse)k
 Who’s responsible for decisions on 
software for your IT strategy?
Caution
º Keep your listen to talk ratio always at 80/20 or better¤
º Do not skip prematurely to RUIN or Multiply - reps do this because they’re 
impatient¤
º Go back to ROUTE over and over and over again until DM is confirmed¤
º Never start pitching until you hit the POLARITY shift (remember, they trigger the 
pitch by desire to hear it).
Why don’t traditional phone approaches work like “the reason for my call....” – you 
interrupt and spotlight yourself vs. the prospect speaking. You disagree and 
overcome objections vs. agree. 
Traditional scripts are Kung Fu. RRM is Aikido. I interrupt you and within 3 seconds, 
I’m getting you to confirm your exact name pronunciation (Dale Carnegie, most 
beautiful sound in the human language), your power (what you do), then getting you

to open up to me about latent pain (SPIN questions).... This removes all the friction 
and recoil from the call. Speed to trust quantum leaps.
Warning: In 2007, with this technique, I started to close deals fully on the first call. In 
the 2020s, there are 12 decision-makers in a deal, so “closing for time” is your best 
bet — aka landing the meeting (the 1st commitment).
Signs you’ve done this method right:
 They ask you for time on your calendar!
 They suggest or ask permission to bring multiple stakeholdersw
 Deal velocity speeds way up — show rates move to 90% plus for meetingsw
 Call time balloons over 10 minutes but sales cycle length comes down 
under 45 days.
Classical cold call (old way)
Åw Interrup¾
¼w Don't let them tal¿
«w Pitch your product
§w Persuade, convince, argue
With RRM the spotlight is on the prospect, not yourself and you're agreeing, 
listening, and peeling the onion the whole time — it's never been done in 20 years.
Rules
Strive for 85/15 even 95/5 listen-to-talk ratio. If you ever go above 50% you’re talking 
way too much.

Wait for the POLARITY shift — keep asking open implication need     pay-off — PAIN 
funnel — peeling questions until they ask.
Wait what do you do? 
Wait, can you do that? 
What’s your name again? 
What’s the company called?
This is the Vampire Rule — you must wait for them to desire knowing what you offer.

Thoughts Bump

Bump
This is a reply to an email you've already sent that "bumps" the original message up 
in the prospect's inbox.
Philosophy
In a typical Agoge style sequence, you will see this as the "Re: ..." in the subject line. 
Difference is we're not suggesting new ideas in the bump messages. The intention is 
to refer back to the original message instead of sending a string of independent 
messages over time. We also are not waiting more than 24 hours to bump the initial 
message. If you had Ariana Grande tickets for the weekend and messaged your
friend on Monday, then didn't hear back — how long would you wait to follow up? 
You'd probably send another message on Tuesday, trying to make sure they 
remembered your invite. There's no need to flood the prospect's inbox with 
additional messaging if they haven't had a chance to answer the first time. Asking    
if they have any thoughts is like giving them a free pass for ignoring you the first 
time — let's give them the benefit of the doubt. There's a great chance the prospect 
was busy the first time a random stranger sent them a message about solving some 
business problem for them. You're opening another loot box — giving yourself 
another chance to book the meeting without being overbearing.
Controversy
This strategy gets the most pushback as we train sales reps and leadership teams. 
People have been hypnotized to imagine politeness is more important than urgency 
when breaking into new business. The laws of physics are different top funnel — 
there's so much competition it does not pay to be patient and wait. But the brave

sales stars who were bold (or desperate enough to try anything) and run this play
are seeing results. Every day I see another success story in our Discord that a 
meeting was booked via "Thoughts?" as a reply bump. One of the top JMM 
practitioners selling into F500 accounts said every meeting in a 4 month span came 
from a thoughts bump. If you're getting ghosted — try adding this to your playbook.

2-template System

A Word of Caution
The Regime does not want you to believe the following is possible. Modern sales 
training and technology is designed to make you rely on them and track your 
activity, rather than produce results. Today is the day you take the power back.
Preamble
The following two templates have generated millions of dollars in consulting fees 
and SaaS revenue. I designed this two template system in 2020 after making the 
realization that there was a connection between the target accounts regardless of 
the business prospecting them. Two different products selling to Acme could send 
almost the same email, switching a few details depending on which area of the 
business they wanted to impact. You can customize this way without any personal
tidbits about the recipient.
Suddenly, it hit me that everyone was overlooking the most important details, 
focused on their own company and tidbits about the individual. Hypothesis: all you 
need to do is make it look human, include lookalike case studies, and demonstrate
domain expertise. This was tested and proved to be an industry agnostic solution for 
setting meetings.
It would be very difficult to see this new paradigm without writing sequences for 
hundreds of different businesses in a short time frame. This framework allowed me 
to churn out a custom sequence that would set meetings usually in under an hour. 
Nobody else in the SaaS industry or elsewhere has cracked this, because if they 
had, they would be setting meetings with it.
I took this concept one step further and analyzed all of the messaging that had been 
written across dozens of clients. This is where the two template system was born.

Every business that hired me to write saw a significant lift in all metrics from cold 
email, and I was using the same 2 templates for everyone. Now I'm releasing them 
into the wild.
Template 1
subj: growth
Hey {firstname} - curious if you’re open to chat re: [business function] strategy? 
[Similar customer] was able to [quantifiable outcome], saw a reduction in [pain 
point] and [positive outcome] using [process]. If it makes sense Q4, should we 
set up a call? Thanks -{sender initials} 
Template 2
subj: innovation
Hey {first.name} -- any initiatives to allocate budget towards [business function/
tech category]? [Customer] saw [outcome] and [x%] decrease in [pain point] --
[differentiator]. If this is your radar Q4, talk soon? THanks {Sender.initials}
Template 1 Alt
No case study / new vertical
subj: growth
Hey {firstname} - curious if you’re open to innovation re: [business function]? 
[Alternate industry companies] are leveraging [process] to [outcome],  
reducing [pain point]. If it makes sense Q4, should we set up a call? Thanks -

Executing the system
V Cluster them together as outlined in 3 Cluster sequenceO
V Be strict about cluster 1 bumps mentioned thereO
V Cluster 2 bumps<
V Use customer quotes bump 1O
V Bump 2 use screenshot of the product or a Forrester/Gartner diagram, 
company website visual, stat from a different publication, etc.;\
V If you can't stretch, go with a single customer quote bump for cluster 2O
V Swap out the use cases you highlight by persona and run 3-5 contacts per 
accountO
V If they don't respond in 10 business days, 2 clusters bumped twice each, swap 
for another contact3
V Either alt title with same message or a flank title asking for a referral.
Expect to see 60%+ open rate, 10 to 15% reply rate, and at least a 5% meeting 
booked rate. Those meetings should convert at 90% or better.
